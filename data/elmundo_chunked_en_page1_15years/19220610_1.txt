Opinion of Judge Berga in the matter of "Habeas Corpus", filed by ledo. Cuevas Zequeira
JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF HUMACAO, P. R. IN THE DISTRICT COURT Hilario López Cruz, Petitioner - # -vs.Félix Calzada, Warden of the District Jail, Respondent. Criminal No. 4320 HABEAS CORPUS -RESOLUTION- Hilario Lopez Cruz, incarcerated in the district jail of Humacao by virtue of a writ of imprisonment issued by the district attorney to answer the charge of violation of article 91 of the Penal Code, filed, on May 22, 1922, a petition for habeas corpus, alleging as sole basis the lack of probable cause justifying the deprivation of his liberty. The petitioner was released on bail during the pendency of the appeal, and then filed, with leave of court, on May 31, 1922, an amended petition for habeas corpus.
May 31, 1922, an amended petition, in which he alleges as grounds, the following: "That the arrest and detention of the petitioner is illegal inasmuch as the warrant does not allege facts sufficient to charge the accused with the commission of a crime of violation of Art. 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the restriction of his liberty suffered by the petitioner is also illegal, since there is no probable cause to justify the charge against him of having violated the said Art. 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. "3.-That the only evidence presented against the petitioner consists of a sworn complaint by Juan Robles, in which it is substantially alleged that the petitioner has unlawfully, willfully and maliciously refused to surrender to the said Juan Robles the files, papers and documents pertaining to the position of Public Service Commissioner, Police and Prisons of the Municipality of Fajardo, being so that the said complainant is reliably informed that the petitioner has been a respondent in two civil controversies provoked by the said Juan Robles, as plaintiff, and in which the complainant Robles has been defeated, by virtue of "(dontinúu in lá' page 3a.',

Time passes, and what was preordained in the book of destiny happens. Then we understand the opportunity and scope of that instinctive act of volition.

Mr. BARCELO GIVES US HIS IMPRESSIONS ABOUT THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE SCHOOL PROBLEM US MANIFESTATIONS C0NTR.ADIC10RIAS Dfl SENIOR JUAN B. HUYKE
Yesterday afternoon we accidentally met the President of the Senate, and of the Economic Commission, Hon. Antonio R. Barceló, who, in spite of our repeated insistence, refused to make any comment for publicity on the latest events which have been so much in the public eye these days. i - "Why should I say anything? All these ■ things that are happening are being commented on by themselves.'' -And with regard to the school problem that is looming, in view of the next salary cut, what is your opinion? Have you read Mr. Huyke's statements, recently published in the Republican party's organ, "El Tiempo"? -The school problem, which is a serious one, really, can only obtain a satisfactory clone solution by labor Refined sugar was quoted yesterday at $6.75 in S. J. The Pesquera office tells us that refined sugar was quoted in San Juan yesterday at the price of $6.75. Raw sugar, according to reports, was quoted at about $5. As is to be expected, there is a favorable impression in financial circles, and it is expected that sugar will reach better prices in a few days. The local market is more lively and several operations of legislative importance are about to take place, and their solution would be easy to find.
The solution could easily be found by shortening the school year to nine months instead of ten. This was the practice followed in Puerto Rico in previous years and has always been followed in the United States. This would enable us to pay the teachers the salaries they now enjoy, and if by this means we should be short of money to pay salaries, we could make use of the $75,000 savings on books which the Commissioner of Instruction has promised to make, and of $30,000 appropriated to the Economic Commission, which will not be expended by that body in the coming fiscal year. -Could not the appropriation for the Governor's private expenses also be used for that purpose? -Man, your indication is helpful. That is a matter that the Legislature could very well take into consideration and I am sure it would consider it, for the benefit of the teaching profession and public instruction, so much in need of our most determined protection and help. i -Did you notice Mr. Huyke's statements? -They are a corroboration of what I have just told you. His remarks -- | THE NEXT JERSEY CITY BOXING FIGHT NEW YORK, June 9.-Boxing promoter Tex Rickart has just signed a contract with Jack Britton, light heavyweight champion, and Benny Leonard, lightweight champion. The fight will be 26 of the current, "Ür -y -aw se-Iprolongaráwaá" of fifteen rounds. I
He states that he does not want his first schools, but advocates that there should be fewer of them. -Could you tell us something about what the Commissioner means by abolishing inter locking? ) - I don't know, as it is in English. And - I don't think anybody knows what it is. ) At that moment someone came up > to the group where the leader ! of the majority party was conversing and said, that i the Ledo. Huyke had advised the Governor not to convene the Legislature for an extraordinary session, even if advised to do so by the Economic Commission, because the purpose of the 3 legislators was to suppress the Executive's private expenditure. With this news, the meeting ended without making any comment on it. As we said, yesterday at ten o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor of the second section, Mr. Massari, left for Humacao at ten o'clock in the morning. As we said, yesterday at ten o'clock in the morning, the prosecutor of the second section, Mr. Massari, left for Humacao, with the purpose of presenting before the Grand Jury of that Court, now in office, the cases followed against the former municipal judge of Fajardo, Mr. Bolivar Pa- ¡ gán. According to our reports, the prosecutor! Massari had the idea of returning to San Juan last night, as soon as he submitted to the judicial organism.
