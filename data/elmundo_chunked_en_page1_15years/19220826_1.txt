YESTERDAY WAS HEARD BEFORE JUDGE FOOTE THE "MANDAMUS" FILED AGAINST MR. LIPPITT BY THE HEAD OF THE CHILDREN'S ASYLUM.
THE COURT ADJOURNED UNTIL MONDAY TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO PRESENT THEIR ARGUMENTS
Yesterday was held before Judge Foote the hearing of the "mandamus", established by Mr. del Rosario, against Dr. Lippitt, so that he may be reinstated in the position of Chief of the Children's Asylum, from which he was removed by the defendant, without fulfilling the requirements of the Law. Dr. Lippitt appeared together with his attorneys, Mr. Lopez Acosta and Mr. Llanger, from the Department of Justice. Representing the plaintiff were Messrs. Rivera Zayas and Figueroa represented the plaintiff. Mr. Rivera Zayas began the hearing by presenting as additional evidence to the case file, a communication from the Civil Service Commission regarding the transfer of Mr. Rosario, which later culminated in his dismissal; another document, showing that the matter was brought before the Civil Service Commission, before being brought before the Court, and in which document the Commission states that the matter was brought before the Civil Service Commission, before being brought before the Court. Mr. Rivera Zayas also presented two notarial acts: the first, to prove that the petitioner's supposed substitute, Mr. Triza rry, took possession of the position in dispute on his own account, and the second notarial act purely to prove that the petitioner, by virtue of the obstinate attitude of Mr. Lippitt and the current Director of the Asylum, was arbitrarily removed from the position he occupied. The petitioner then testified, who, upon questions from the defense, gave a history of the matter, stating in his statement that no charges were ever brought against him to remove him from the management of the Asylum, whose position he attained through competitive examinations. Then took the witness chair, <the defendant, Dr. Lippitt, who began by saying that he harbored no feeling against Mr. Rosario, and that with much sorrow in his soul he had had to change him from the position he had, due to certain deficiencies that resulted from the investigation of the case, and that he had to be removed from the position he had, due to certain deficiencies that resulted from the investigation. And for cemeteries, torches, crosses, statues and attributes. 0. Bartoli Art Studio Go. Do not confuse our house, which is pure and genuine Italian.
The Commissioner said that he had been examined by an Inspector of the Department of Instruction, deficiencies which were later confirmed by Dr. Lippitt, who personally visited the Asylum, which, according to the Commissioner, led him to the conclusion that the plaintiff did not meet, in his opinion, certain conditions for the performance of the position of Director of the Asylum. Mr. Lippitt also said that in view of these circumstances, he ordered the transfer of Mr. Rosario to the position of Food and Drug Inspector, from which he subsequently had to "separate" him because the petitioner did not take possession of the position. Mr. Rivera Zayas cross-examined the witness for about 15 minutes, and then made very pertinent statements about the powers that the Commissioners have with respect to their subordinates, and the rights that protect them, in accordance with the Civil Service Law, of which he said the notable jurúcon sulto, which ensured the competence and independence of the employees of the Government. Specifically in the case of Mr. Rosario, he expressed that he had been arbitrarily deprived of a position that he had obtained in good standing, through strong competitive examinations and not through false doors..... That Mr. Rosario is protected by the Civil Service Law, which mandates that employees be given opportunities to defend themselves in case of dismissal, which, the attorney adds, has not been done with him, in flagrant violation of the statute that guarantees the rights of employees. Mr. Lopez Acosta then said brief words, and, finally, the Court granted the parties until Monday to file written pleadings. DOÑ J. A. GONZALEZ Our good friend Don J. A.

MR. SIACA PACHECO WAS PERSONALLY INFORMED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT HE WAS GOING TO APPOINT HIM SECRETARY-ATTORNEY OF THE COM. DE SERV. MR. ABOY, WE ARE ASSURED, HAS IN HIS POSSESSION THE LIST OF EMPLOYEES TO BE REMOVED FROM THE TREASURY.
In the afternoon of yesterday and to the ears of our reporters, the news arrived that the Governor had officially communicated to the officials whose resignations, a week ago, we had to inform that they would be asked to resign, his intentions to carry out the announced changes in his Administration. A letter was sent to Mr. Benedicto, the text of which we have not been able to ascertain, and a copy of which neither party was willing to furnish us, since the above-mentioned communication has not yet been the subject of a reply from Mr. Benedicto. However, from extraoficial reports that we have been able to obtain, we know that the content of the aforementioned letter consists of the Governor informing Mr. Benedicto of his desire to make a change in the Department and indicating to him the need for him to present his resignation from office, so that he can carry out his reorganization proposal. Although we have not been able to verify this officially, we understand that in the aforementioned letter Mr. Benedicto is offered another position, that of Professor of the University. After obtaining these reports, last night we exchanged impressions with Mr. Benedicto, and he confirmed the news that he had received the Governor's letter, but refused to give us details of it, nor to provide us with a copy of it, because, as he told us, he did not think it proper to do so until he had answered it. Regarding the matter of the Ledo, Mr. Ramon Siaca Pacheco.

The public continues to insist on the public's support. The public continues to insist that Mr. Ramon Aboy Jr. will be appointed Treasurer, "n substitution of LedoBenedicto and yesterday it was assured that Mr. Aboy already has in his possession the list of the officials of the Treasury Department who are to be removed from their posts, in accordance with the policy which the Governor is preparing to put into practice. As to the attitude which the leaders of the Union may adopt in regard to these latest actions of the Governor, we are unable to give any definite information, for nothing is yet to be said as to the political question involved. Countless cablegrams have been sent to the high authorities in Washington, so that we are awaiting instructions from there, to act then in accordance with the policy which the circumstances may dictate. The purpose pursued by the leaders, judging by the comments made in political circles, is not to initiate any formal protest yet, nor to adopt any attitude until the attitude of the metropolitan authorities can be clarified, since in this way the party complies, giving an opportunity to the National Administration to sanction or condemn these actions of the Governor. We understand, moreover, that all these changes have been made to take effect on the first of next month. HINTON'S TRIP .
