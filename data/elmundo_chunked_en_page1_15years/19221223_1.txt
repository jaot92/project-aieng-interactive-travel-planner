Mr. Pesquera's attorneys intend to file an appeal.
In view of the fact that on Tuesday, the 26th, the term granted to our esteemed friend Don Mariano R. Pesquera, to begin serving, in the Mayagiltz Jail, the sentence of 40 days which was recently imposed upon him by the Federal Court, expires, an editor of ours approached Mr. Pesquera yesterday to know if he had resolved to begin serving his sentence, or if on the contrary he intended to appeal the judgment to the Boston Court. Mr. Pesquera was unwilling to tell us anything for the sake of publicity, as he wishes to keep absolutely confidential in regard to this matter, which is, he told us, in the hands of his attorneys, who are the ones called upon to inform us as to the steps to be taken. Notwithstanding this justified refusal of our friend, we learned later that, after a series of consultations held among Mr. Pesquera's attorneys, it was agreed to propose to take the appeal to the Circuit Court of Boston. In this regard, the aforementioned lawyers are working to finalize the appeal before the Circuit Court of Boston. We take this opportunity to wish our many readers, relations and friends a happy Easter. LAUSANNB.

A TRUE TRIUMPH Last night we had an opportunity to see a beautiful film at the Tea. Htro Rialto; "The Affairs of Anatol" starring Wallace Reid, Gloria Swanson and a large ensemble of stars, is a valuable gem of silent art. The theater was filled with a select audience that admired the delicate program of the Bruno and Vázquez Circuit, agreeing once again that the best and most varied films shown today in Puerto Rico are those imported by this reputable film company. Since the friends Vázquez and > Bruno launched "Fascinación'' by i i i Mae Murray, their first program, to the i canvas of the theaters, in Puerto Rico, . ! they won the public's confidence and ! it is to be seen how the theaters are filled every time a film of the L I I Circuit is announced. The triumph of the tireless directors of the Bruno and Vazquez Circuit is to be admired. In a short time this firm, composed of two Puerto Ricans, has become the strongest film rental company in the Antilles and perhaps in Central and South America. Soon this company will be able to bring a daily production to the theaters of its theatrical chain.... -| Our most sincere congratulations to our friends Rafael P. Vázquez and Jlnio R. Bruno. ; P.
