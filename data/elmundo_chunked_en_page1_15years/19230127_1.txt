THE LCDO. CELESTINO]IRIARTE JR.'RESIGNED AS P'TE. OF THE LOCAL BOARD
Yesterday we proceeded to file for registration the judgment in the electoral lawsuit with attached affidavit, stipulating $50,000 in costs.
Yesterday afternoon we learned that Ledo Celestino Iriarte Jr. had resigned as president of the local board of the Unionist Party in this capital. Our reports, although absolutely reliable, could not, however, be verified. Our reports, although absolutely reliable, could not, however, be confirmed by Mr. Iriarte himself, due to the fact that it was materially impossible for us to interview the esteemed Senator. We do not know to date the moti-* ves that Mr. Iriarte may have had for adopting this attitude, nor do we know, moreover, that any disagreement of any kind has occurred between him and the Secretary of State.
between him and the other leaders of the collectivity. Exchanging impressions with some prominent members of the referred party, we can say that Mr. Iriarte's decision has been greatly regretted because his work in favor of the local triumph of the Union of Puerto Rico has always been praised by all the Unionists, especially since, in these last few days, Mr. Iriarte has been the most praiseworthy of all the Unionists. Iriarte lent to the affairs of the lawsuit his most determined and í collaboration, taking upon his men a most principal part in the work and responsibility of such laborious litigation. I There is a belief that the causes i,
Iriarte's resignation are not due to political reasons. Since this resignation reached the Local Board late yesterday afternoon, we cannot yet say what will be the attitude adopted by that body in this respect. REGISTRATION OF JUDGMENT Yesterday afternoon was ordered the filing at the Registry of the Pro- fession of this city, of the necessary documents for the registration of the judgment rendered in the election suit for the purpose of securing the right of the defendants to the payment of the costs to which they have been ordered to pay.
