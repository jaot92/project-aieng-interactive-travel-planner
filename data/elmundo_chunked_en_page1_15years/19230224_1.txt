NUMBER 1239.
Speaks of the nomination of an energetic candidate for Governor of Puerto Rico.
A distinguished gentleman residing in this city, received yesterday a long letter from one of the physicians of Ja "Metropolitan Insurance Co.'', of New York, informing him that the most probable candidate for the governorship of Puerto Rico, is Mr. J. E. Coates, a close friend of President Harding and a stanch supporter of his policy. We were also told that, although Mr. Coates is an energetic man, a strongman, and is familiar with Puerto Rican temperament and idiosyncrasies, he would not employ the same methods as his predecessor, Mr. Reily, but on the contrary, would employ good manners and use diplomatic means to win the friendship of the Puerto Ricans, whom he loves very much. Mr. Coates has at present a sick son in Saranac Lake, N. Y., who is attended by a Puerto Rican doctor. Mr. Coates also holds the view that all public offices on the island should be held by Puerto Ricans. Some time ago the government of Washington offered the said gentleman the post of "Attorney General" of Puerto Rico, a post which he refused because he considered it of secondary rank. We were also informed that numerous elements of the Puerto Rican colony in New York had recommended Mr. Coates for Governor of Puerto Rico. NEW IS A FRIEND OF MR. ROBERTO H. TODD Mr. Roberto H. Todi, leader of the Republican party, will not embark on March 4 codfc had been assured.

days ago, but has postponed his trip to a week later. A well-known element of the Republican party assured us yesterday that Mr. Roberto H. Todd was in Washington making representations in favor of the candidacy of Senator Harry S. New for Governor of Puerto Rico. Mr. Todd is a close friend of Mr. New, who has been said these days to be a likely candidate for governor of the island. In spite of such disparity of opinion as prevails in regard to the appointment of the future Governor, we were categorically informed yesterday that the only probable candidates under consideration by the Administration were Messrs. Towner and Waldo, and among them the former is the one who has the full sympathies of the Government at Washington. ■ - A CONFERENCE OF ITALIAN AND FRENCH POLITICIANS - ROME, Feb. 23-According to the "Popolo d'Italia" a conference will very soon be held here between Italian and French representatives to discuss the Ruhr situation and the collaboration that should exist between the two Governments.

Executive Secretary Saldaña sent the list of appointments to the Senate yesterday.
IF THE SENATE ACTS ON THEM, IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED, IT WILL PROBABLY RAISE A VERY INTERESTING LEGAL QUESTION.
One of the most delicate and serious questions that has arisen in the present conflict between the Legislative and Executive Branches has just been raised by the request made by the Secretary of the Senate to the Executive Secretary for a list of each and every appointment made by the Executive during the time the Senate was not in session. Yesterday afternoon we learned that the Executive Secretary, Mr. Saldaña, had sent the Secretary of the Senate, Mr. Muñoz, a certified copy of the appointments made during the recess and which are currently pending confirmation. This situation would not be of a serious nature were it not for the fact that its aspect has changed since the Acting Governor addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Senate, warning the high legislative body that the sending of this list of appointments should not be understood as the official act of the Executive, to submit for its "consideration to the Senate such appointments, since he would send them for that purpose when he deemed it convenient. We have endeavored to exchange impressions in this respect with noted personalities, in order to obtain a legal opinion as to the true nature of the conflict which would arise in the event that the Senate should meet in session and proceed to confirm and disapprove all or some of these appointments, ignoring the letter and the statements of the Acting Governor. Of particular interest is the legal issue involved in this important matter. A calm analysis of the matter almost leads to the conclusion that the Senate may act in confirming or disapproving such appointments without their having been formally submitted by the Governor. The Organic Act, in one of its articles (article 26, it seems to us), when it describes the powers of the Senate, specifically declares that the said High Chamber shall be vested with the same legislative powers as the former Executive Council and with the power to confirm appointments. It then adds that appointments made while the Senate is not in session shall be effective until the same are rejected by the Senate, or until the Senate rejects them.
The Act then adds that appointments made while the Senate is not in session shall be effective until they are rejected by the Senate, or until the expiration of the next session of the Senate. Nothing is said in the Act as to the manner in which the Governor shall submit the appointments to the Senate, nor is the time during which the Governor shall submit such appointments to the Senate specified; but, what the Act does clearly determine, is that the Senate has the power to reject and approve appointments made while that body has not been in session, and to exercise that power it cannot wait for the Governor to choose the occasion for the exercise thereof, because it might thereby deprive the Senate of the exercise of its power to make such appointments while the Senate is not in session. thereby deprive the Senate of the exercise of that constitutional power, by not sending the appointments at any time and waiting for the expiration of the term of sessions to reappoint them. According to the judgment of persons bieji versed in these matters, it may be stated that the Governor, once he exercises the power to nominate a candidate, is under the obligation to send to the Senate at the opening of its sessions ín mediately, a notice of ha(thmtfn continued on 1a *3rd. page) I A NEW TRIUMPH Just obtained it ' * * The Fisk Tire | Co- Inc." by building the SUPER GO MA 30x3 1|2 type TRUCK CORD.
