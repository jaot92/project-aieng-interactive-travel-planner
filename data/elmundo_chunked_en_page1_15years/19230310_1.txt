IN THE CONTEMPT HEARING IN THE FEDERAL COURT IT WAS ORDERED THAT DR. COLL Y CUCHI BE ORDERED TO APPEAR BY CABLE. COLL Y CUCHI
IT WAS ASSERTED THAT THE PROSECUTOR HAD ACTED ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.
This matter had its origin in a report recently rendered by the Grand Jury of said Court.
Yesterday morning, at snow, the hearing in the contempt case against Dr. Victor Coll y Cuchi; Police Colonel Bennett; Detective Chief Harding and Ledo began in Federal Court, as announced. Cayetano Coll y Cuchí. The first of the aforementioned defendants did not appear due to his absence in the United States. He represented Ledo. Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, the distinguished attorney Ledo. Frank Dexter; for Colonel Bennett the assistant-Attorney, Mr. Loret, and for the Je fe de la Detective, the notable juriscon sulto Mr. Hugh R. Francis and former prosecutor Miles N. Martin. After the Court was declared open, the halls and corridors of which were crowded with a large audience, mostly lawyers and persons of significance in the forum and politics, the reports were opened by Ledo. Joseph A. Toret, who made to the Court a thorough exposition of the case, analyzing the accusation against his defendant, Mr. Bennett, in all its different aspects. Among the important allegations made by Mr. Loret in his brilliant report are the following: That the indictment did not state whether Colonel Bennett or the Chief of the Detective. Mr. Harding, had had the express intention of intimidating the witness Torres, or of pressuring him in any way to influence his mind with respect to the testimony he had given before the Federal Court. "It is not even alleged," said Mr. Floret, "that these police officers had any knowledge that the 7th Season Performance.

Dr. Victor Coll y Cuchi proposed to have *.er such a thing with the witness''. He argued that for the crime to exist it was necessary o. to prove these constituent elements of the crime, and to prove in addition that obstruction in the administration of justice had been effected by the acts of the defendants. The Ledo. Loret argued that the indictment was not sufficient to sustain the guilt of his defendants and that, therefore, the Court should dismiss the indictment. The Ledo then took the floor. Frank Dexter, who began by stating that he was appearing in the name and on behalf of his partner and close friend Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, for the purpose, he said, of demonstrating and convincing the Court that the prosecution's information was not only inconsistent as to the charge against his defendant, but that it was absurd. "To prove that," Mr. Dexter argued, "does not require a great deal of talent or extraordinary legal skill. x (Continued on page 3) DR. POLANCO GONZALEZ Our friend, the young and notable physician Dr. Polanco Gonzalez intends to reopen his medical office in San Juan, 72 San Francisco Street. The office of Dr. Polanco Gonzalez will open on the 15th of this month in one of the most central places of the capital and will have a competent staff, as well as the latest modern advances of the current century. Dr. Polanco is not unknown in Puerto Rico; in spite of his youth, he has made his personality and professional competence stand out, to the point that recently, during Dr. Figueroa's absence, he served, for four months, as director of the Maternity and Children's Hospital, in which position he had an extensive practice in the treatment of childhood diseases, which is his specialty. We wish the remarkable doctor flattering successes, to which he is entitled by his competence and his profound scientific knowledge.

THE IDEA OF A COMPLETE REORGANIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF SUCCESS.
SEVERAL PROJECTS ARE DRAFTED BY LEGISLATORS ASSISTED BY THE 'BAR OF LAWYERS' AND THE 'ATTORNEY' Instead of two, the judicial district of San Juan will have three judges with concurrent jurisdiction.
In view of the insistent talk these days that the Island Judiciary will be completely reorI ganized in the next Legislature, a reporter of ours interviewed yesterday with the Hon. "Attorney Genej tal", Ledo. Salvador Mestre, in order to hear from the lips of this high official, all that he would like to tell us about the matter, because given the nature of the matter, no one better than the Head of the Department of Justice could inform us. To our questions the Ledo. Mestro told us: "Yes, for some time now the idea of a reorganization of the courts, especially the municipal courts, some of which are overwhelmed with work, while others do not have enough work. Several bills have been prepared in previous years by the Attorney General's office; I personally prepared one which did not come before the legislature, but this year there seems to be a purpose to reorganize the icsticia courts definitely, and I understand that there are several bills under preparation and study by several of the senators and rc1 rSsntaíítes; and I am myself working on a new reorganization which I will submit to some of my friends in the legislature so that it may be taken into consideration in connection with other bills. -¿ ? -The district courts of San Juan seem to be undergoing a radical change, for the present organization is not the most convenient. The American Bar Association, which is actively concerned with all questions relating to the practice of the profession and the administration of justice, is carefully studying the matter with a view to furnishing the legislature with data for the purpose of making a law for the organization of the district courts, that the Ordinary General Meeting agreed to distribute a TWENTY PERCENT dividend, which will be paid immediately at the offices of the Corporation ALLEN 89.-SAN JUAN, PTO.

I to of San Juan, so that I may briefly dispatch civil matters and attend at the same time to the large number of criminal matters which are unduly delayed there. I -¿ 7 -I have in preparation, moreover, a law establishing the payment of costs in the Supreme Court. It is not logical that before this high court a number of small matters are brought which em1 Largan the time it needs to devote to the intricate juj iidicoí problems that are presented to it,, for the sole purpose of delaying a few days the execution of a sentence. This real abuse on the part of reckless litigants would be cut down to a great extent by establishing reasonable fees and bonds to answer for them, which in any case would leave safe the rights of poor people, who could litigate as insolvent, as they are doing today before the lower courts. -¿ ? -In the reorganization project, San Juan will form only one judicial district, which will be provided with three Judges acting in three sections; the first will attend to all matters of a civil nature, of a cious nature, and all others not expressly assigned to another section; the second shall hear civil appeals, ex-parte filings, special legal proceedings and divorce and divorce suits; and the third, criminal cases originating in the district attorney's office and appeals from judgments rendered in criminal cases by the municipal courts and justices of the peace.''
