1A HEARING HELD YESTERDAY BEFORE THE FEDERAL COURT AGAINST CAYETANO AND VICTOR COLL Y CUCHI, WILLIAM R. BENNETT AND f. HARDING
st TUESDAY, TUESDAY 20, FOR THE RADICATION OF EA CONTEST IN CNANTO TO BENNETT, TO RESOIVER EA "MOTION TO QUASH" REGARDING HARDING V FOR THE PRESENTATION OF AUTHORITIES IN THE CASE AGAINST THE LCDO. CAYETANO COLL AND CUCHI
At 2:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon in Federal Court, the motions for dismissal filed in the contempt case against William R. Bennett, Frank F. Harding and Cayetano and Victor Coll y Cuchi were argued and argued. Counsel for the defendants appeared, with the exception of Mr. Víctor Coll y Cuchí, who, as our readers know, is out of the country. Attorneys Loret, Martin, Francis and Dexter as well as prosecutor Wells argued at length my different points of view, and at the close of the argument, the Hon. Judge of Court I made the following rulings, as to the issues raised by defendants Bennett and Harding: "The defendant, William R. Bennett, has filed a motion to dismiss the Information on two grounds, as follows: (1) The facts alleged in said Information render defendant William E. Bennett guilty of concision of a contempt. (2) The facts alleged in said Information do not make defendant William R. Bennett guilty of pressuring or attempting to pressure a witness. This motion has been very ably argued by counsel for William R. Bennett, and the Prosecutor has presented his arguments to the Court for the Court to consider.
Bennett's counsel, and the Prosecutor has presented his arguments to the Court to sustain his prosecution. This is an exceedingly unpleasant and "unwelcome'' case for this Court. It would be highly aggravating to me, if I could find a way to expeditiously grant this motion. But, as there is a specific allegation in the fifth paragraph of the indictment, that the purpose of Victor Coll and Cuchi, to use two detectives for the purpose of intervening in pressuring a PREPARATIONS FOR THE RECEPTION OF GOVERNORTOWNER Yesterday there met at the Fortaleza, at the invitation of the Acting Governor, the Heads of Departments, Mr. Cochran of the Colonial Bank, the Colonial Bank, the Governor of the United States and the Governor of the United States. Cochran of the Colonial Bank, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of Puerto Rico, and other significant personalities to discuss and agree on the festivities to be held on the occasion of the upcoming inauguration of the Hon. Horace M. Towner, as Governor of Puerto Rico. Various committees were appointed, for reception, decorations, banquets, dances, etc., etc., etc. Up to last night the program had not been definitely drawn up; but it can be assured that the inauguration of the new governor will constitute an extraordinary event without precedent.
It is further alleged in the aforesaid indictment that Chief Quiñones, one of the officers of the detective force, expressed his objection to the use of two members of the detective force in the manner in which they had been requested; and as it is further alleged that William R. Bennett ordered Quiñones, one of the officers of the detective force, to be present at this meeting, and as it is further alleged that William R. Bennett ordered Quiñones, one of the officers of the detective force, to be present at the meeting, and as it is further alleged that William R. Bennett ordered Quiñones to be present at the meeting. Bennett ordered Quiñones to send those two detectives and that he did so with full knowledge that those detectives were to be used for the purpose of pressuring a government witness, it is my judgment, without question, that if the charge is true, William R. Bennett is guilty of contempt of this Court. Therefore, I am not compelled to deny the motion on the first of its grounds. As to the second ground, it is alleged that the facts as stated in the indictment do not make the defendant William R. Bennett guilty of having pressured or attempted to pressurize a witness. It seems to us sufficient to say that the Information does not charge him with having pressured or attempted to pressure a Government witness; but it does charge him with having furnished the material which he furnished to Victor Coll y Cuchi in pressuring a Government witness. That is what he has been accused of and that is the element in the case, which I am obliged to sustain. | I am not convinced that he is in contempt of this Court, if true.
Of course, that the filing of this motion to dismiss does not deprive the defendant, or any of them, in any manner whatsoever, of presenting their defenses to the indictment, and it is, therefore, ordered that the motion to dismiss be denied and the defendant William R. Bennett will answer the indictment on or before Tuesday, March 20, 1923, at noon." Defendant noted exception to the foregoing Resolution. The following was the Resolution rendered as to the defendant Frank H. Harding: "The defendant, Frank H. Harding, has filed a motion to dismiss, based upon the following two points: 1.

THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE, MR. LASTRA, IS STUDYING AN IMPORTANT BILL TO ENHANCE THE CITY OF SJ.
According to this bill, the municipality of San Juan will operate independently from the other towns in the island, and the municipal administrators will be appointed by the legislature and the governor of Puerto Rico.
For days now, news has been circulating in the city's political circles about a bill to make San Juan independent from the rest of the island's municipalities, which the Vice-President of the Lower House, Ledo. A. Lastra Charriez.
The Assembly will be assisted by two commissioners to be appointed, jointly and respectively, by both insular Houses and the Governor of Puerto Rico, adding to these commissioners a corps of engineers, from among those assigned to the Department of the Interior.
All laws on the subject approved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico shall be approved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. THE LOCAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH. We interrupted Mr. Lastra to ask him a question about the time for which the above-mentioned officials will be appointed. -These commissioners," he replied, "will be appointed for a term of four years, and will form what we may call the 'Local Executive' of our capital. The "quorum'' will be constituted by at least two commissioners, and the resolutions and resolutions to be adopted will be limited to the powers conferred by this Law on said commissioners. SUS TEMA CONTRIBUTIVO Mr. Lastra went on to enumerate the advantages contained in the new form of municipal government for San Juan. -At present," he said, "the tax system determines that the Island Treasury is in charge of taxing property throughout the island, levying taxes and collecting and distributing the same in accordance with the Law. In the first class municipalities the Insular Government would keep for it, under the pretext of expenses in the collection and imposition of taxes, 10 percent of the total collected, which, together with 38 percent that must also be given to it for other atenoions, is to be used for the collection of taxes.
The bill shall also provide for the appointment of a Board of Municipal Instruction, which shall be elected proportionally by the electorate of San Juan. This body will be put into effect, under the inspection of the said three commissioners,
With reference to this matter we have heard it spoken of several times and in gatherings of legislators this problem was raised on more than one occasion by the intelligent and active delegate. Yesterday, he finally announced his intentions to present the bill as soon as he begins his term in the Legislature. In his office in Parliament yesterday morning a reporter of ours visited the Vice-President of the House. At the hour when we arrived at his office, Mr. Lastra Charriez was very busy in the study of 1 several bills relating to revenue, for, as we have learned, he has si<l£> appointed Chairman of the Finance Committee of the House. Having learned of the object of our presence there, he suspended his work and set out to please us. His talk was a "brief session" lively and picturesque. It did not resound with thunderous shouts, -as in the House-, nor did the presidential truncheon have the gestures charged with violence, or to muffle the stridencies of some Representative of the minority. But, in short, let us summarize the matters about which the popular representative spoke to us, so that the reader, who is perhaps in a hurry, may know this part of the work that the distinguished Representative will carry out in the next Legislature. THE PROJECT -My bill -synthesizes Mr. Lastra- aims at establishing in San Juan de Puerto Rico a municipal government by commission, equal or similar to that of the Capital of the United States. The advantages of this system-he continued-will be absolutely good for the community. It will provide for our capital city to be governed by three commissions.
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO RESIGN HIS OFFICE IN BRIEF As our readers know, yesterday the press of this city reported that several letters had been received here from the United States, informing that the National Administration had resolved to ask the Hon. Salvador Mestre, Attorney General of Puerto Rico, to resign his office. In regard to this incident, a reporter of ours yesterday exchanged brief words with Mr. Mestre, who, in spite of the reserve he keeps' in relation to this particular, stated that he had indeed received two letters from friends suj{p,s, resident in Washingi ton and well connected with the affairs of the National Administration, suggesting to him the advisability of tendering the resignation of his office, on the understanding that it would perhaps suit the interests of all, under the present di. I fficult circumstances. On asking Mr. Mestre what he intended to do in this case, he replied that he was considering the matter and would decide in due course what to do, BRENNAN IS IMPROVING NEW YORK, March 16. - Eli Brennan is improving from the blows received in his fight with Firpo.
