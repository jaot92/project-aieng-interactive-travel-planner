INTERESTING DISCLOSURES BY EX-GOVERNOR REILY, MADE FROM NEW YORK, (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA).
ALLUDES TO COLONEL BENNETT AND THE MECHOLE RECEPTION HERE
Ex-Governor Reily has addressed to the editor of the English page of * 'The Times'' the following letter: New York, April 23, 1923. Br. Editor of 'The Times'. I have read in the San Juan papers the statements of Chief of Police Bennett in the case of contempt of the Federel Court. and to say the least, they are startling from every point of view. El Tiempo" said that Mr. Bennett was cooling his heels while testifying with some written notes and even those previously written notes do not seem to have helped him tell the truth about me. I must not leave unanswered some of the things said by Mr. Bennett, not only because they were untrue, but because they were unnecessary attacks made on a friend and which call me into question. My friends in Puerto Rico told me who Mr. Bennett was, although I never believed it, always defending him to the last. I made him Chief of Police even against the majority of my advisors, later allowing him, against the law, to occupy one of the best houses of the island government where he has lived since then rent free. Now he has turned against those who defended him and is going out of his
He now turns against the one who defended him and goes out of his way to say things, in the witness chair, which were not only untrue but which are not at all favorable to him and which only tend to prejudice me. Mr. Bennett stated that I had told him that I was using the Coll to wipe out other leaders of the Unionist party. I have never said such a thing to anyone, nor have I ever done so, and if I had done so I was too clever to say it to the Chief Constable. I think the latter should look at his notes and see if he has not made a mistake. I think he would not have sworn when he wrote these notes of his statements prior to his testimony in Court. Anyway those notes did not "refresh" his memory, at least at this point. He also said that I was very concerned about some anonymous letters I received threatening me that I was going to be killed. It is true; I received those letters daily but they never made me uneasy because I knew, because I know that Torriquenos of all parties are peaceful and law abiding; and that those anonymous letters came from some nutcase. One day I found in the palace a maniac who was stalking me; I handed him over to the police and they locked him up. After (Continued on 3rd. page)

THE SECRETARY OF WAR DECLARED IN I PONCE THAT CERTAIN COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE ACTIONS OF GOVERNOR TOWNER HAD BEEN WHISPERED TO HIM.
I ADVOKED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE TO PREVENT MORE CAPITAL FROM COMING TO THE ISLAND THAN EXISTED AND CONSIDERED THE "PROBLEM OF ILLITERACY WITH THE EXISTING SCHOOL PROGRESS" TO BE EASY TO SOLVE.
At the time of the toast, the Mayor of the city, Mr. Parra Capó, offered the tribute - pronouncing a speech that we consider to be of great importance. course which we consider to be of great discretion and loftiness of thought if we take into account the circumstance that, although Mr. Parra was an active politician, his message lacked all passion, and was limited to bringing to the minds of the guests that all evidence of progress and advancement in our island were demos i IN SEPTIMA PLANA £/ Process of the Catholic Prelates in Moscow - - - - Sensational articles by Francis Me Cullagh. He said that we Puerto Ricans should no longer remain as minors subject to guardianship: He made the promise and emphatic assertion that the whole country was keenly interested in progressing more and more every day. He ended by praying for the President's health and for the prosperity of the nation. Mr. Parra then announced that Senator Robinson, one of the Democratic leaders of the upper house, was going to speak. The distinguished congressman spoke with such enthusiasm and sincerity, he put such warmth and enthusiasm into his words, that his speech produced great emotion in his listeners. He said that because their knowledge of the needs and problems of the country was so limited, they were pleased to have heard all the tendencies. He offered that they would all be interested in the welfare of Puerto Rico, and said that Congress would surely grant Puerto Rico whatever Puerto Rico wanted, and ended his speech by reciting some admirable stanzas by the great American orator Daniel Webster. I American orator Daniel Webster. '
When our reporters transmitted from the city of the South synthetic details of the magnificent and splendid reception that was given there to the Hon. Secretary Weeks and his retinue, they could not give even a vague idea of what was and meant the enthusiastic and brilliant reception with which the Ponceña society greeted its distinguished guests. The Sports Club, which was where the retinue was first held, was a veritable colony of charming ladies and distinguished ladies, and there were also representatives of all the organizations and entities of the city, among which were the gentlemen of the highest standing in the forum, banking, commerce and politics. I - The Secretary's private secretary, Mr. Martin, made the ritual presentations and the Ledo. Parra Ca- ! pó and his worthy wife did the honors with characteristic distinction and courtesy. Once all the introductions had been made, the Ledo, Don Martin Travieso turned to Secretary Weeks and announced that he was going to introduce him to the youngest person among those assembled. The illustrious politician, moved by curiosity, accompanied our Mayor, who took him to a place in the hall where he was peacefully asleep, in the arms of a lady, a little boy barely two months old and belonging to one of the most prosperous families of that city. The Secretary felt an extraordinary complacency before that pre-sentation and with all the tenderness and tender affection of a grandfather who is already the grandfather of six little ones, he took one of the little hands and kissing it, began to tell him phrases of affability and affection among them: "I have six grandchildren like you. How beautiful you are! God bless you! etc.". The eyes of the notable politician and of the man under whose direction are all the instruments of war of the nation, were moistened with tears, as Mr. Tra- j vieso said, apparently remembering his absent grandchildren. THE MELLA BANQUET Ocrea of four hundred diners occupied the tables in the spacious dining room of the Hotel Melia. The menu served was magnificent. |
Senator Robinson was warmly applauded. THE SPEECH BY SEC. WEEKS When Senator Robinson finished, Secretary Weeks took the floor: "Mr. Mayor and fellow citizens: i - began Mr. Weeks - it is a great pleasure for me to make public recognition of this spontaneous tribute that is given to those who are with me tonight and to myself as well. It is what we could expect from city of this importance, But the warmth of your tribute is I something that is beyond what we could expect." He said that before going into the subject he wanted to say a few personal words, and then exalted the personaí lity of Mr. Córdova Dávila, of whom he said that although he did not have the right to vote in Congress, he occupied a car- ■ go, for that reason, of a diplomatic character. "In that capacity," he added, "I have had the opportunity of discussing with him, Puerto Rican affairs very often, and it is a great pleasure to me ■ to say that although I have not always agreed with him and have found it necessary to say no instead of yes, I can say that he has represented your interests in an industrious or intelligent manner and that he is entitled to the good will of the people of Puerto Rico." | As to Judge Towner, Governor of our island today, he said that he had been appointed in view of his excellent statesmanlike qualities and that there was perhaps no one in Congress who was more in touch with the affairs and politics of the possessions and territories than he was. In this connection, and as if to imply that he was in sympathy with Judge Towner and in support of his policy, the Hon. Secretary made the remarks which we are now transcribing, which produced a real sensation among the audience, showing that in the two days of his stay on the island Mr. Weeks had received the muted and concealed censure which it is customary to give when there is dissatisfaction or displeasure. The word "whispered" which is used in the translation replaces the English word "whispering" and which gives in di1erent language a more graphic meaning.

10 WHAT'S IN PUERTO RICO AND 10 WHAT'S NOT IN NEW MEXICO
On our journey to the Southern city, in company with the retinue of the Secretary of War, we were accompanied by the Hon. A. A. Jones, Senator from the State of New Mexico, and his distinguished wife, Mrs. Jones. During the entire journey, the illustrious visitors did not cease to ask us questions about the different landscapes along the way, with the object of our describing them to them, in order to know the natural charms of our island, which, according to what the distinguished couple expressed, the United States is becoming more and more interested in. To our words, Senator Jones always put some affectionate comments, extending himself in the data that we gave him in diverse considerations, about our Agriculture, commerce and industries, and being interested because it is made propaganda in the United States, and the two biggest works of San Juan, Capitol and González Padín Building, that have consumed until now MANY THOUSANDS of cubic meters of BLUE LIMESTONE, have been supplied of this excellent material by the one that subscribes. The efficiency of our strong daily deliveries can be testified by the renowned construction engineers Pons and Carbla, respective contractors of these works.

The aim is to improve these, as well as the general conditions of the island; "the better use of its natural resources, by making them known and proposing suitable measures for their utilization; to encourage interest in the organization of industry, by virtue of appropriate legislation; to work for the united effort of farmers and merchants, making each one conscious of the acts he performs, so that "what is done is done," and that there will never be need to resort to troublesome rectifications. * p ABOUT MR. REILY. The talk with Mr. Jones was a lecture on political economy. On several occasions we diverted the conversation to know his personal opinion regarding ex-governor Reily. i Mr. Jones stated that it seemed that Puerto Rico had never sympathized with the aforementioned governor, since the reports he had confirmed this. The illustrious traveler expressed that he did not know Mr. Reily personally, but that, from what he had been told, the ex(Continued on page 6) 'Olimpo' Theater SUNDAY, MAY 6, 1923.
