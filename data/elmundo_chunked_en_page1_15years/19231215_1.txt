THE CURRENT TREASURER DENIES THAT HE HAS BEEN OFFERED BY ANY ENTITY ANY CHECK IN CONNECTION WITH THE PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS.
The following report was furnished to us yesterday by the Treasurer of Pto. Rico, Mr. Bonner, in connection with information published yesterday in our newspaper concerning alleged administrative arrangements with several sugar corporations: With respect to the information published by the newspaper BI> MUNDO in today's edition, (December 14, 1923), under the heading "IMPORTANT REDUCTIONS ARE SAID TO HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE CORPORATIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HDA. DE HDA. On this occasion, and if this policy is followed, it is insisted that the Treasury did not have the necessary margin for expenses", I wish to make the following statements: According to the receipts from July 1 to November 30, 1923, and after a careful and conscientious study of the probable receipts up to June, 1924, it has been absolutely concluded that the budget of twelve millions can and will be covered in full. In order to reach this conclusion, the various laws on tax procedure have been amended, and Thomas Meighan and Leatrice Joy in "BACHELOR DADDY" (BACHELOR DADDY) Tomorrow Sunday May Me Avoy in FOR HER REPUTATION ■" Bolivar Pagan -LAWYER- .

In addition to current contributions, the amount of contributions outstanding at the date of the preparation of the budgets has been taken into account for this year. The collection of these arrears is being actively pursued and the most lisong success is crowning the activities of the Treasury Department. As to the coming year (1924-26) it will not be necessary to take into account the balance of the collection arrears on June 30. 1924. because by that date the laws imposing -contributions for the various items of revenue, have to produce a greater amount than was calculated in the revenue estimates. With respect to 'o what is stated in the information of EL MUNDO, that : the Treasurer of Puerto Rico made administrative arrangements with the sugar corporations which were investigated by the Department in order to procure the necessary funds, it is my duty to state that in all those cases in which an investigation has been made to verify the income statements rendered, the result of the investigation shall be notified to the taxpayer and he may, in exercise of his right, before appealing to the appeal granted to him by the Act, request the Treasurer of Puerto Rico to discuss the increases that have been made in his income.

For the first time in the history of the Volstead Act in P. R., an individual will be declared a social nuisance, by a certain legal proceeding in the] Federal Court.
Juan Cruz is the most terrible alleged smuggler who has ever stepped on the slabs of the aforementioned court Yesterday a man known in Mayagüez as Juan Cruz (*) Caja appeared before Judge Odlin of the Federal Court. This subject was brought from the city of the West, to enter the jail, pending the holding of several cases for crimes of Prohibition. More than twenty different indictments for violating the prohibition law have been filed against this wretch, and the Court, as indictment after indictment was read to him, heard from the defendant's lips, with astonishing calmness, the plea of - guilty or not guilty, as the case may be. The defendant has a terrible frankness; perhaps he does not realize his situation. What is certain is that yesterday he was taken to the galleys of the San Juan jail, until the trials against him will be held next Wednesday, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Jncidentally the prosecuting attorney, Ira K. i Wells, in this case has filed . against this defendant a special law proceeding, because he understands that this defendant, according to the terms of the National Prohibition Act, constitutes a public nuisance, and should be removed from the community, so that he may not commit any more crimes. This complaint was read to him by Continued on page 8 L -í.

The Chief of the N. Y. & P. R. S. R. S. S. Co.
tells us that the steamer 'San Juan' will be destined for the transportation of second-class passengers between the U. S. A. and the U. S. A. SECRETARY WEEKS DOES NOT SEEM TO FAVOR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN MARITIME BUSINESS Yesterday we published some notes on the steps being taken in Washington by the Resident Commissioner, Mr. Córdova Dávila, to have 2nd and 3rd class passenger transportation services established between the United States and Puerto Peak. As the said notes tell us that Mr. Cordova was counting for his plans with the help of the steamship lines working between this country and the Northern Republic, we decided yesterday to see the Chief of the New York and Porto Rieo S. S. Co., Mr. Nadal, to find out how he thinks about this important matter. Mr. Nadal stated that he did not wish to discuss the matter as yet, as he was awaiting details from the New York office; but, nevertheless, he informed us that they had decided to put the steamer "San Juan" into service for second class passengers, and that for this purpose the ship will leave San Juan at noon on the following dates: January 30, February 20, March 12, April 2, April 23, March 1 and June 4.
The shadow of a mysterious trunk has crept into the Mona scene, where eljontrabando was caught.
It is believed that an accusatory index emerges from the interior of that piece of furniture that belonged to the smugglers. As in all things of this world, around the discovery of the* enormous contraband on Mona Island, a small novel is developing, one of those that could be used to make a movie; and all, as far as we have been able to deduce, because of supposed rivalries between policemen of one post or the other. The versions we have about the matter are more or less as follows: A detective stationed in Mayagüez went to Boquerón and began to ask all kinds of questions to a boatman about what the policemen and the Prohibition agents who went there found on the Isla de la Mona. The questions, as it is natural, made the skipper of the boat "ear-tickling". Subi next, that secret agent, ¡ has continued his inquiries, and has ■ asked other persons who have ' come and gone from Mona Island, on the occasion of the smuggling, about an alleged trunk which appeared or i was found on Mona Island by the expeditionaries, which? 'is now made to appear, or is imagi- , nan, to contain documents com- ! promising to the smugglers, and moreover, fantastic legends are forged in regard to the trunk in question, as to whether it will contain this, that, or the other. There is the supposition that the action of this secret agent is due to the de(Continued on p. 7.) m, . II ÍIT-TT r i ■ ■ ■ I I I . 1 11 " "TiWMr- wt ---irril -
PRESIDENT COOLIDGE AND THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE THE FIXED PURPOSE OF SANCTIONING, WITHOUT RESERVATION, THE POLICY OF THE LATE PRESIDENT HARDING.
i ' ' ' CONFIRMATION OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL COATS DEPENDS ON HIM PROVING THAT PRESIDENT HARDING INTENDED TO NOMINATE HIM In the interview which we published yesterday with the Socialist Senator, Mr. Iglesias, we neglected to make mention of a matter which is of extraordinary importance and which has been the subject of various infor. marions by the different local newspapers. We refer to the question of the confirmation of the appointment of Mr. Herbert P. Coats to the office of Attorney General of Puerto Rico, which, judging from the information that has reached us, seems to be rather doubtful. x Senator Iglesias, in the interview we had with him, told us that in this respect the situation in Washington was such that it did not seem to favor the confirmation of this official because it appears that the Republican National Committee had various political motives for not endorsing the confirmation of this appointment. There is also, according to what Mr. Iglesias told us, the circumstance that since the Republicans on the island are part of the National Republican Party, the National Committee of said party understands that it is its duty to attend to the demands that the Republicans on the island may make of it and it seems that the Republicans here have strongly opposed the confirmation of Mr. Coats. Mr. Iglesias told us that when he was asked in Washington about the convenience of confirming or not this appointment, he had to say frankly what was the feeling of his party and he highlighted the errors that, in his opinion, Attorney General Coats had committed during his term of office, among them the theory that the socialist judges could not hold their positions nor should they be appointed even if the socialist party had won the electoral triumph in that community. - . Finally, Senator Iglesias told us that if Mr. Coats presented, on the record, sufficient evidence to show that former President Harding had intended to appoint him to the office he now holds, then he would be confirmed whatever charges might be brought against him. "There is a purpose," said the Socialist leader, "on the part of President Coolidge and the National Administration to endorse and sanction everything done or proposed to be done by the late President Harding, not only in his fundamental policy but in the matter of appointments." And Senator Iglesias concluded by saying that this could be verified in the statements made by President Coolidge at the time of assuming the Presidency and lately in the message he addressed to Congress.
