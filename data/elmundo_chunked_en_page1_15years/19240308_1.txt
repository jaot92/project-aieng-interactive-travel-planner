Barceló and To|to Soto does not I commit anyone; it is a : truly transcendental document. The island has to feel and think with it; the rest is to act very badly against the country and against the homeland. i ' wnrraiTFi RlCO. He must be appointed Treasurer of Puerto Rico, as required by the current state of affairs and imposed by justice. Known aspirants to the post of Treasurer of Puerto Rico are working with influential political personalities and certain political Committees so that these entities will make recommendations to the Unionist Committee chaired by the indefatigable fighter Mr. Antonio R. Bareeia. The theories of those who maintain that the position of Treasurer drt "t W occupied by a *'significado.potfttos*', were condensed fa a "MM "taro and prectao in "La CirrMpfadtaWls do Puerto Rieo" áI 9 4to MrtM" rtltltüno.

It seems that Mr. Tons Soto's intention is to give sufficient opportunity to all members of the Steering Committee to meditate well on the situation and to be able to properly polish public opinion on the island ■ Speaking to us by telephone he expressed his criterion of not advancing demonstrations or commenting on the telegrams of protest he has received - Almost all Republican leaders refrain from making demonstrations - Feliá drowns because of a transfusion in his blood.
Yesterday afternoon we were in , telephone communication with the distinguished politician Don Jose Tous Soto. He knewwc* that they had dfio "aviado" ÍúuniorMos telegram" do protest with Ull "rt "hiitiHrt -WMtoa i<AAWirteute Political Manifesto that is already known of all the country, and we wanted to know what was his criterion before this attitude of numerous of his co-religionists. [Mr. Tous Soto told us that he was perfectly calm and satisfied with his attitude. With regard to the telegrams of protest that he had received, he told us that he did not wish to say anything, that he left it to each one to adopt the position that best suited him and that everyone was free to think as they wished. He told us that perhaps this was because they had not fully understood the scope of this movement; but that in any case he recognized that everyone would be willing to support the ideas they had put forward. When we told him that we wished him to make some statement as to the reasons he had had for adopting this attitude, he replied that the reasons and motives he had had were explained in detail in the terms of the Manifesto itself. The meeting of the Territorial Committee did not want to tell us anything about the attitude that he would assume towards the Territorial Committee when it would take the decision to adopt such an attitude.
The Committee will be held at the Territorial Committee when the Manifesto is raised there; but he did give us a telegram * to each and every one of the members composing the Territorial Co- - " tor - eírtófi'suya " for the following Sunday, instead of tetabeartat as had been announced, on the following Sunday. I It seems to be the intention of Mr. Tons (Soto, to give áM rtfatonte oportani- , given to all lo" direetofoe del Pacido i to think and meditate well about the and thus be able to have the occasion to properly press the opinion of the island, before rushing to adopt an action that could be detrimental to the collectivity.

Sir:- I am replying to your letter of March 5, 1924, in which the Jury's attention is drawn to the strict application of Article 41 of the Regulations, as amended on September 12, 1923. I must point out that if the Jury can be accused of anything, it is of applying the Rules strictly to the letter, which has given rise in different cases to unjustified protests on the part of the horse owners.

lluestro illustrious colleague Don Mariano Abril was appointed yesterday director of "la Democracia" IttNte for the freedoms of the fiáis, k being ono of Muñoz Rivera's companions I - ? *. Yesterday our distinguished friend and illustrious comrade Mr. Mariano Abril, who was many years ago, Director of the same newspaper, and who worked all his life with the great patriot Mr. Luis Muñoz Rivera, was appointed Director of "La Democracia". ! The appointment of our compmñero Abril must surely be well received by the island, by that thinking and patriotic island, by that discreet and talented island, which, when it sees a man rise, if he has merit and prestige, contributes to his triumph and his success. The name of Mr. Mariano Abril is as well known in Puerto Rico as that of Muñoz Rivera or Pepe de Diego. That is why his appointment to the leadership of our newspaper "La Democracia" has been very well accepted by all, by all those who carry in their hearts the feeling of Patria, the true idea of what it is, patriotism and hermapdad.
