The situation should be analyzed seriously --Reasoning is needed, not offensive phrases.
11 setal Constitutional Charter of the Sadafist Party approved at Peace in Me of 1923 contains principles rafal pe be ¡ncompatibks, with the amitos upon which the two historic parties of Puerto Rico stand, in relation to the existing order of things We hold that there can be no * 'intelligences* ' in Puerto Rico between -I Socialist Party, as it is at present and either of the two historic parties, because the "Socialist Party" maintains certain basic ideals which characterize it and which are alien to the doctrines of the other parties. ■ J '4| It is being studied at this time how the Socialist Party and the Bepublican Party can find a formula of intelligence. Either the "understanding" between the Socialist Party and the Bepublican Party is DE FONDO or it is CIRCUMSTANTIAL for electoral purposes. If it is DE FONDO, there is no doubt that one of the two parties would have to ' break its program to submit to that of the other. If it is CIRCUMSTANTIAL, then the Socialist Party would be failing in the duties imposed on it by its Constitution, which obliges it to pursue as an essential aim the radical change of the present machinery and not merely to contribute to the passing of the springs of the present machinery from Unionist hands into other hands.

Valldejuli Rodrigue! nes made these statements yesterday: -'Martinez Nadal. Todd.

There is no respect for the President, nor respect for the collectivity. Martinez Nadal and Géigel should have already resigned their positions of trust in the party. A Vice President who attacks the policies of a President, unless he has not resigned his position before, is a man whom the public opinion has to accuse of disloyalty. And a Secretary who acts in the manner that Géigel is acting leaves much to be desired as to his fitness for such a position. And Todd and Becerril, also important members of the Republican Party, are only cooperating in a dark work of disorder and anarchy within the Republican Party.

Noted attorney¿Mr. Francis H. Dexter states in his sensational statements that if the PueMo'de Puerto Rico submits to the dictates of the Secretary of War, "then yes, it is proven that this People 'will not be able to survive' the war.
Puerto Rico has been so long, he adds, under a bureaucratic administration that its political leaders tremble at the slightest hint of displeasure from any bureaucrat, and its political leaders tremble at the slightest hint of displeasure from any bureaucrat, he adds.
While one of our Repre, seated with Mr. Francis H. ' Dexter yesterday, it occurred to him to ask him if he could say something about the politics of the parties," replied the lawyer, "I do not wish to make any statement because I am far removed from active politics, but, my friend, I am grateful that he has given me the opportunity to express my protest against the attitude of the Secretary of War, Mr. Weeks, who has launched an attack on the United States. Weeks, who has launched I a ucase stating that he will not aproi the bill for Governor I elective unless such bill has -;i effect not earlier than the year 1932. and even by that date Congress should not give i its approval if illiteracy has not been reduced to rn thirty per cent of the inhabitants of the island. "Whatever the final status of Puerto Rico may be, I am in favor, as every Puerto Rican should be, of the immediate granting of the amendments to the present Charter which were the object of the campaign recently held in Washington by the Committee of the Legislature.

i justifiable condition placed by SeI cretary Weeks on the granting of the rights to which the portorríque- ños are entitled. ! "After twenty-five years of pre ; paration. Sacrifice, and loyalty, and des- ; After the patriotic and most brilliant campaign waged by the members of the Committee of the Legislature, on behalf of the three parties of the island, the Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States, having carefully studied the demand of the Puerto Ricans, and representing the generous sentiments of the people of the United States, have tavoraoiemously amended the bill of Puerto Rico in request of their right to elect their own governor. It would be an unpardonable weakness and an ignominious submission if after all this the condition imposed by Secretary Weeks were accepted: "Notwithstanding the liberal and generous manner in which the national administration attends to the affairs of Puerto Rico, its form of government of this island is purely colonial and anti-democratic, and when carefully observed by the good inhabitants of the United States, the government of Puerto Rico is a purely colonial and anti-democratic one." .... .-*■ - - +' We NEED some competent salesmen for the automobiles we represent PACKARD, HUDSON and ESSEX.
