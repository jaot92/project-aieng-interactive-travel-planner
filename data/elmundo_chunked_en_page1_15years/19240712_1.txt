The Commissioner of Instruction, Juan B. Huyke, finally recognizes that against the student Ochoteco an unjustifiable arbitrary action was committed.
The abnormal situation through which the University of Puerto Rico is passing has already reached a period of extreme gravity and the adoption of energetic measures to halt the progress of this state of affairs, which no one knows the consequences it might entail, is imperative at all costs. For a long time we have been insisting from these columns, pointing out the evil and begging that it be corrected in order to avoid having to be ashamed later on of the discredit that could fall on our highest Teaching Center. We consider that this matter has already been so widely debated, in the press, in the House, and in the centers of government, that we are almost ineligible to believe that a firm intention has been made to consent to the demoralization of the University in exchange for the personal prurience of not correcting the determining causes of these evils. The inquiry held a few days ago by the House of Representatives, resulted in the adoption of a report declaring that Professors John and Osuna were incapacitated, by their lack of tact and discretion, as well as FROM TODAY has been opened to the public at the SOJO PHARMACY at stop 15 a new department of automobiles, tires, gasoline and automobile effects.

for the prejudice they had against the student body, to continue in . the performance of their duties without our being exposed to be constantly ! regretting unpleasant incidents ■ at our University. So far the Board of Trustees has had no opportunity of dealing with this matter; but it is certain that in that body there is a spirit of unanimity that a manifest injustice and great arbitrariness was committed by Mr. St. John in withholding the Law Diploma from young Ochoteco, a student who should have graduated at the end of this last school year. The Commissioner of Instruction, according to his statements before the investigating committee of the House, was justifying this action of St. John and the military instructor and even went so far as to say that he was the one who was the one who had to justify this action of St. John and the military instructor.

We thought that after the promise made by the gentlemanly Colonel of Police, Mr. Lewis, regarding the persecution to which the excellent caballe. ro Don José Remotti was being subjected, we would never have to record in our columns such an outrage.
