-Governor Towner's proclamation is the result of an agreement of the Island Board of (lessons, ratified and approved by the Alliance members who are also members of the Board," says di An- tonio R. Barceló, "and the Board of Governors.
tonio R. Barceló "THE ALLIANCE TO TRIUMPH IN ALL THE LINE, DOES NOT NEED PRIVILEGES OR PREROGATIVES.-THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE INSULAR BOARD OF ELECTIONS TEND TO PUT AN END TO THE HULLABALOO OF SUPPOSED FRAUDS THAT BOLSHEVIOUES AND CIGARS PROCLAIM"-HE ADDS "THE INSPECTORS HAVE THE POWER TO DISMISS THE OBSERVER WHO DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH DUTIES, And even to replace him with any other, if the PARTY TO WHICH SUCH OBSERVER BELONGS DOES NOT TAKE IMMEDIATE MEASURES",-CONTINUES SAYING
One of the afternoon newspapers, in its edition of the day before yesterday, gave a long report, in which it said that many leaders of the Alliance were not satisfied with the terms in which the proclamation of Governor Towner was drafted, as far as the Socialist observers were concerned, and that furthermore, there was the idea that such a disposition could only be adopted by the Island Board of Elections. In the information, the idea was expressed that it was necessary to summon the Board of Directors of the Alliance, if such a state of affairs really existed. Barceló, requesting from the illustrious politician, and leader of the Alliance, some manifestations in this respect. Yesterday morning, we found him in the editorial office of "La Democracia", attending to numerous affairs and political friends, even though his state of health demands rest. But in these moments of intense 'ncba, it is impossible for the supreme leader to abandon the direction of affairs, and yes, Don Antonio is fighting like a good man, in front of his hosts. The illustrious President of the Senate, gave us the following very interesting statements: "None of this has any foundation. Precisely, the proclamation of Governor Towner, obeys an agreement of the Insular Board of Elections, ratified, approved by the members of the Alliance, who are also part of the Board. The socialist observers have not been granted any power, but on the contrary, duties to fulfill. The sole purpose of this measure is to prevent them from being able to adduce pretexted, since that seems to be their intention. -Pass your orders on time.
The fact is that the United States has been the only country in the world that has not been able to get a chance to get the orders. I í i i THERE IS NO NEED 1 FOR PRIVILEGES r ' I "The Alliance, in order to triumph in all - the line, does not need privileges or prei rrogatives. Simply, lag nemos j plugged the mouth with a single word, i this is by imposing on the observers > the duty, of stamping their initials on . each ballot. "In addition, we have imposed on them the duty, the obligation, to keep a list of the electorate, so that they can take note as each voter casts his vote. In this way, they will not be able to say later that it was others who voted. * But where the real crumb in the matter lies is that, at the same time that these duties are imposed on the observers, the inspectors are given the power to remove the observer who does not comply with such "duties, and even to replace him with any other, if the party to which said observer belongs, does not take steps to replace him immediately. ACABANDO con LA ALGARADA - "Simply, the resolutions of the Insular Board of Elections in this regard, tend to end once and for all, with the hullabaloo of alleged frauds, touted by the Bolsheviks and cigars, anticipating the events, and declaring itself of GRATIFICATION Will be rewarded the one who gives reports about the automobile CHEVROLET license plate No. 885 that disappeared at stop 17, Santurce on October 17, at 9 o'clock in the evening.

Very poor, indeed.

! "We will sue a local newspaper for libelous libel in Federal Court, and former Judge Silva in District Court, ' asking at the same time for $50, 000 damages-say Messrs. Roig and Roca, candidates for Senator and Mayor of Yauco.
"We congratulate the Hon. Governor for the success in his dismissal, and also Colonel Lewis for the success of the Insular Police in charge of keeping order in Yauco", -they add "We will file several accusations against a local newspaper for Infamatory Libel, requesting at the same time S50.000 for damages before the District Court and before the Fode-al Court," Messrs. Roig and Roca told us yesterday morning, when we saw them at La Fortaleza where they went to confer with the Executive about the last article published by a colleague of ours, authorized by former Yauco Judge Ledo. Silva. "THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT KNOWING HOW TO ACT AS A JUDGE" As our readers know, Ledo. Silva submitted his resignation to the Attorney General as Judge of the Yauco Municipal Court. However, the leaders of the coalition in the beautiful city made it known that it was not a resignation but a dismissal. "Judge Silva had created a policy of privileges for the aliancistas, in a town of coalitionist majority, "says Mr. Roig, candidate for district sanator uor the district." And" therein lies his mistake". "Now the municipality is in a perfect state of order, the people are going through a period of harmony, and we hope that it will continue to be so, even after the elections, which will necessarily leave a huge coalitionist majority. "We hope that the success of the election will bring persons of character and equanimity to fill the public positions of greatest responsibility." "THE POLICE, VERY PERFECT" I "It is our duty to ponder the rectitude of the Island Police, commanded there by Je a man of character and integrity. Colonel Lewis has been very correct as far as we are concerned. "The success of the Police is a credit to the peaceful and just situation prevailing on all sides." THE ALLIANCE DOES NOT DARE TO GIVE RALLIES IN YAUOO "The Alliance does not dare to give rallies in Yauco because it wastes time and money," says the eoalicicnista candidate for Mayor of Yauco, Mr. Ignacio Roca. "Lately," he adds, "they gave a political party, which cost them more than two thousand dollars. "Believe me when I tell you that they have no desire left. No one goes to those public purchases which they call rallies. "Nc.-.others of us have a huge majority in the municipality of Yauco, and I can assure you that we will win by about 2,090 votes.

It is known that some five thousand animals have already been slaughtered by the American Government, a cordon of federal troops having been formed purely to completely isolate the infested areas. Our authorities, taking into account the frequency with "which cattle have been imported here from Texas, and in anticipation of the disease spreading to P. R., have adopted all the necessary measures to avoid it, because in case the terrible epizootic should reach the island, it would cause a real disaster in the cattle industry. ALARMING NEWS The news received in San Juan, coming from E. are alarming, since they speak of the spread of the disease in the city of Houston, Texas. Texas. The characters of the epidemic are very virulent, much more serious than in California. The Texas outbreak appears to be unrelated to the California outbreak. If truly drastic measures were not taken, there would be the fear that the foot-and-mouth disease would spread to the island; but, in order to avoid this, as we have already said, our authorities have dictated the most energetic measures, among them a very rigorous quarantine.

Dr. Mohler, Chief of the Dept. of Animal Industry of Washington, declares that the outbreak in Texas has no connection with that of California, the former being of a more terrible character than the latter, to the extent that the cattle die in the most tragic and violent manner imaginable. It is not known at this time what our authorities would do if a case were to arise here.... But it is possible that they would have to do what is being done in the U.S., that is to say, exterminate not only the sick animal, but all the animals of all species that have lived with the first one. In view of the seriousness of the case, farmers should cooperate with our authorities in this regard, since, after all, it is in the best interest of no one but them that the terrible eplzxtotía does not visit us.
