Undoubtedly the Ledo. Guerra-Mondragon will be the Pres, of the House Finance Comm.
II minority candidate, pira member of that committee, is Rep. at-hrge, Mr. Alonso.
The Senate has proceeded to appoint the gentlemen who will form the Finance Committee, undoubtedly the most important of that ■ high legislative body. The senators appointed to constitute it, , are the following: Sánchez Morales, Jordán, Mena, ' Zeno, Aponte, Ducós, Martínez, and . Figueroa. However, our readers will ' , realize that the Senate Finance Committee, according to the law, consists of nine members, and that only eight have been appointed. There thus remains a vacancy which will be filled in due course. As to the chairmanship of the . . moa understood, the arrival of Mr. Barceló is awaited, since the appointment will be made in accordance with the circumstances. As promised by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Mr. Hernandez Lopez, to Senator Martinez Nadal, as soon as Iglesias arrives, a readjustment of the commissions will be made, in order to give due participation to the minority. I
THE HOUSE FINANCE COMMITTEE. The Finance Committee of the House will be composed of eleven representatives, since at the last session of said high body, the Rules of Procedure were amended, increasing the total number of members of said permanent committee from nine to eleven. | In this way, the Speaker will have more scope to make the appointments. It is certain that, in keeping with traditional custom, the Vice-President of the House, Ledo. Guerra Mondragón, will be the Chairman of the Finance Committee, since both positions have always been consolidated, it could be said. THE MINORITY As for the participation of the minority in that Commission, it is believed that the representative at-large for the Socialist Party, Mr. Rafael (Alonso, who on another occasion has already been appointed as Chairman of the Finance Commission, will be appointed to the Commission, as he is a representative of the Socialist Party, Mr. Rafael (Alonso, who on another occasion has already been appointed to the Commission).
Senator Martinez Nadal tells us how he explains Mr. Barceló's insistence in not accepting the Presidency of the Senate
"The reasons that Mr. Barceló alleges to justify his resignation are none other than the pressures that may have been put on him in the Department of War," he says.
Yesterday we visited the President of the Pure Bepublican Party, Senator Martinez Nadal, in his office in this capital. And taking advantage of the opportunity, we asked him several questions, related to the last-minute aconitedmientos, which he answered with his usual complacency. THE MINORITY AND THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE. L- "For the first time, the traditional precedent of our Senate has been broken, and for the first time, the Senate's traditional precedent has been broken.
The traditional precedent of our Senate and of all the parliaments of the world, of giving opportunities to the representatives of the minority to intervene in the various committees, so that they may contribute to the success of the legislation and may carry out their flscaHzing mission, has been broken for the first time. "In the Senate, I made my objection to the President Pro Tempore, Mr. Hernandez Lopez, and he alleged to me that Mr. Iglesias had not asked to be appointed to form (Continued on p. 2).
