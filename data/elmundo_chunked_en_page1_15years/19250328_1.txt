£L LCDO. LASTRA CHARRIEZ IS STRICTLY OPPOSED TO THE HOUSE DISCUSSING EVEN AT THIS SESSION THE INCOMETAX BILL RECOMMENDED BY MR. HAIG

such an important law.
I. LAST HOUR
For some days past, had- . moa news that the Ledo. Lastra Chárriez, showed himself opposed ' - to be discussed even in this- j this session of the House, the "Income-Tax" bill, recommended to the Legislature by the expert in contributions, Mr. Haig, after I ▼art months of studying our : constructive system. But it had not been possible for us ( to confirm the news. However, . yesterday afternoon, Ledo. lastra ; Chárriez himself dispelled our doubts, ma I nifestándonos, that indeed, 1 he would strictly oppose ' that this bill discussed and presented in this legislative session. pbbesntaba a MOTION. Naturally, we asked him what were the reasons that led him to support that criterion. "Reasons?" he said. "You will see them included in the motion that I will have to present in the House next Monday, in which motion I oppose and present arguably amounts to justify my opposition to that bill being brought up for discussion in this legislative session". BASIS. We later learned that among other powerful arguments, the Ledo. Lastra Chárriez alleges in his motion: 1.-That 60 is violating the procedure to be followed, since this bill should first go to the Economic Commission, before being sent to the Treasury Commission. 2-That the time available in this legislative session is not materially sufficient to debate a bill of such great transcendence for the country, which introduces such radical changes in the tax system so far in force in Puerto Rico. IN DEFINITIVE.... Ledo. Lastra Chárriez requested in his motion, presenting arguments and reasons to justify his petition, that the Income Tax bill, recommended to the Legislature by the expert Mr. Haig, and which is now being studied by the Treasury Committee, be passed to the Economic Committee, so that it may be subjected to due study and comply with the regulatory procedures. This very important question will therefore be discussed at next Monday's session of the House. WASHINGTON, March 27. (French OaIrie.)-President Coolidge b* discussed with Mr. Borah Pre-! Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, the draft of the Conference on the Reduction of Armaments proposed by the American government. The se-< nadoi Borah, although in favor of the proposal, believes that the present situation in Europe is not favorable to a forthcoming conference and that it would be preferable to wait for the meeting of the Congress next fall to discuss with the various powers on the subject of arms reduction.

I THE HON. ANTONIO R. BARCELO CRITICIZED YESTERDAY BEFORE THE SENA¡DO THE SOCIALIST LEADER SANTIAGO IGLESIAS PANTIN FOR HIS (PROCEEDING BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY i TO WHICH HE BELONGS - The important official document which we published in our yesterday's edition, prompted the incident. "The Senate has already exhausted its patience with Mr. Iglesias. He has already been too magnanimous. It is time to put a stop to so many insults and insults", says Don Antonio. After having discussed several bills pending solution, the Senate of Puerto Bico, in the ordinary session held yesterday afternoon, was declared in full Committee to proceed to the consideration of several reports presented by the different delegated Committees of the high legislative body. Senator Santiago Iglesias Pantín asked for the floor to express himself regarding a report still pending from the Senate Legal Committee, and having been granted the floor, he began speaking about the duties of the members of the Senate Committees. Senator Iglesias continued speaking, accusing the Senate of proceeding in a concealed manner in its decisions to (Continued on page 4)' I MUNICIPAL THEATER GRAN COMPAÑIA ....

The most beautiful city and the largest city in the world.
A short time ago, a great American publicist, the wife of Senator Kenyon, said in the United States press that Puerto Rico is, without a doubt, the most beautiful country in the world, and she was overwhelmed by the infinite beauty of the island. But the "distinguished writer added a little later: "The only bad thing is that in that true earthly Paradise I saw a greater number of beggars than in all the most populous European cities combined". It is up to the authorities, to commerce, to the wealthy and to the public in general, -we say-, to contribute so that this stain, which dishonors us, disappears once and for all. Of the so-called beggars, 95% are vagahundox. And to extirpate this plague, which disgraces us, very little is needed: Not to give alms, so as not to increase the vice and vagabondage. And to lend the greatest assistance to the "Beggars' Protective Society," which, with extraordinary tenacity, is striving to prevent this stain from spreading, which would be a blot on the progress and culture of the country. i If you are patriots, always remember the words of Mrs. Kenyon!
THE HONORABLE. ATTORNEY GENERAL OF PUER TO TO RICO AT THE REQUEST OF DON EUGENIO PADILLA AND OTHERS REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEYS BENET AND SOUFFRONT, REQUESTS AND OBTAINS FROM THE HONORABLE DISTRICT COURT OF MAYAGÜEZ THAT AN INVESTIGATION OF THE NATURE OF QUO WARRANTO BE OPENED TO DETERMINE TO WHOM CORRESPONDS THE ELECTORAL TRIUMPH IN THE LAST ELECTIONS HELD IN THE TOWN OF MARICAO.
(From our CORRESPONDENT in Mayagüez) Having learned of the resurgence of the judicial proceedings in relation to the alleged electoral frauds committed in Maricao in the last elections, we held an interview with the accredited lawyer, Mr. Oscar Souffront of the firm Benet & Souffront, of this city in his office on Me Kinley Street, who received us kindly, and gladly answered our questions as follows: Q.-Ledo.--Is it true that pigpsa rated to establish a Quo Warranto proceeding in representation of the candidates who appeared on the electoral ticket of Maricao under the insignia of the Eagle, to detenni ¡ nate the validity of the elections held there? 11.-Yes sir. We opportunely requested the Honorable Attorney General, Mr. H. P. Coate, to urge on behalf of the People of Puerto Rico the Quo Warranto procedure, a procedure, in our opinion, within which the Courts could determine to whom the triumph in the last elections held in Maricao legally corresponds. Said official had some doubts at first as to the propriety of said proceeding and requested from us jurisprudence to the effect of determining the propriety of the requested remedy, but upon being furnished by us with the memorandum of authorities and jurisprudence to said official, he, in strict compliance with his duty and honoring the Department of Justice presided by him, immediately hurried to file before the Honorable District Court of Mayagüez the requested Quo Warranto proceeding, which was filed and admitted by the Honorable Judge of the same yesterday. | Q.-Can you inform us why you, being a Unionist, acted in the present case as attorney of the Republican candidacy in relation to the elections held in Maricao? E.-I will say it: Since the proclamation and acceptance of the Puerto Rican Popular Alliance, in my opinion, the partisan lines that contained Unionists and Republicans in opposite sides ended. In Maricao something strange and different from what happened in several towns of the island occurred. The Unionists of the administration, almost all of them of Republican origin, (with the exception of Don Joaquín Oms. who before was Federal and later Unionist), for reasons of lack of political and administrative tact, did not count on the endorsement of his party when the propaganda in favor of the Puerto Rican Alliance began, but against the Regulation of the Unionist Party, and 'in spite of being to " - - i ' nÍWr-11 t MOSAICS If you are going to build see with Ramón Lloverás Soler, so that he buys patent mosáicos of the best quality.

two public employees, appeared improperly to exercise the functions of members of the Committee, even though it later turned out that other persons delegated to them powers to act and even to become members of the Puerto Rican Alliance Committee themselves. The majority of the Unionist electorate and the entire Republican electorate of Maricao, not satisfied with this, united in a bloc of defense and took their case before the Board of Directors of the Alian-' I za, the 'ddfltaiinéías of our eíecl Law, and influences foreign to the true purposes of the Alian-' I za, determined the unusual fact that the majority of the electorate of Maricao did not agree with this. that the majority of the i Unionist electorate of the People of Maricao, above all, the old proi cedent champions of the Federal party, the greater part of the proprietors, merchants and farmers and the vast majority of the electorate, receiving and enthusiastically adopting the Creed of the Alliance, faithful to the dictates of the Directory and united with the whole of the Republi(Continued on pg. 5)

EVERYTHING I DID AND SAID IN THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT MR. COATS I AM WILLING TO DO IT AGAIN UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES," SAYS DON ROBERTO H. TODD.
"I don't care what the Attorney General has reported," he adds, "I like to see the Attorney General active," says Or. Victor Coll y Cuchi, I La. The copy of the report which the Department of Justice rendered to the Governor of Puerto Rico, on the occasion of the electoral disturbances which first appeared in yesterday's edition, has brought about the natural divergence of opinions between the most prestigious elements on both sides of the political spectrum. WITH THE COALITIONIST DIRECTORS The accused by Attorney General Hon. Herbert P. Coats in his sensational and very important ini forme, were visited yesterday morning by a representative of THE WORLD Mr. Robert H. Todd, mayor of the city and well known coalitionist director expressed himself in the following Jcrma: "There are several ways of doing fri duty. If the Attorney General ' thought he was doing his by proceeding in the manner he did, that's up to him.

(Continued on page 8)
After publishing the report of the Attorney General of Puerto Rico, Hon. Herbert P. Coata, to the Governor of Puerto Rico, and considering that this report is directly related to Senator Santiago Iglesias, we decided to pay him a visit yesterday morning to ask his opinion on this important document. We met him in the office he has in his residence in Santurce, and as soon as we informed him of our wishes, he was willing to oblige us. i IT WAS NOT A SECRET ¿ ■ . -> , "Ajtóp ódico EK MUNDO, al pubhciflHB synopsis of the report 30el' Procurador General of Puerto Bico to the Governor, has pi'.esto in evidence, demonstrating to the point that the report that said official called confidential, absolutely confidential!. at least in that part, has j nothing secret, nor is there any reason for it to be known only behind the scenes". - I A CALL FROM THE COBEBNADOB ' What EL MUNDO publishes is part of what we already knew many days before the elections,' when Governor Towner called us to show us the records sent to Fortaleza by the various police officers, in which there was a connection with a distinctly Allied bias in the speeches made by the Coalitionist speakers. Then the Governor, alarmed by such reports. sent directly by the police, and on the other hand, no less alarmed by the manifestations of the Alliance leaders themselves, who did not hide to say that they would win the elections with the *Mesas and not with the popular Masses, {he believed that we were threatened with', a revolution at a fixed date, and that on November 4 the blood would flow in torrents in our streets.

and before the Congress of the United States. "We have asked the Senate for the full and voluminous information which in the last analysis, has only served to discredit us all and to demonstrate that the country is not prepared for the exercise of self-government and to enjoy the American democratic institutions which guarantee to the people the free casting of the vote and the consequent expression of their sovereignty. OF GREAT INTEREST "It is of great interest that the Legislature of the country should know the whole truth, especially all those official reports by which Senators, Representatives, and executive officers of the Government were 'led to believe, that instead of a Governor elected by the people, what was needed was a period of military government. "Why the government in Washington came to the conclusion that the elections in Puerto Rico had been a sham, that is what we want to know, and we have asked the Senate to demand that such reports be sent to it by the Department of Justice, not in part, but in full. EL MUNDO has done a great service, an immense service to public opinion. BAD OPINION ¿- "On the other hand, the very reports of the Attorney General in Washington have certainly made such a bad impression and discredit upon the moral and authoritative aspect of the lucid Department of Justice, that indeed, were it not for the immense damage that would have been done to governmental ethics and the principle of authority, it would not have been surprising to see the adoption of a new law, which, if it had not been for the immense damage done to governmental ethics and the principle of authority, it would not have been strange the adoption of a drastic measure to relegate the Attorney General and the officers under him, from public service, since they so passionately and without damage realized that they were turning the Department of Justice into a club of political biased reports, and prejudicial to the people and to YA LLEGO "TODDY" A shipment of the famous food "Toddy" , half and one pound, has just arrived.
