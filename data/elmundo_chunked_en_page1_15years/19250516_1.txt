NUMBER 2045.
Gov. Towner refuses at all to comment on the appointment of the new.
Senator Martinez Nadal states that he is an advocate of the elective governor for Pyrrhto Rico. But he says that the electoral law must first be amended, guaranteeing that the triumphant candidate will come to power driven by the people. We have been waiting for an interview with the notable senator Rafael Martinez Nadal, because we have always believed him to be an element of value in politics as well as in other activities of our regional life. On two occasions we requested him in his office but he had not yet arrived. But the third time was the charm... and we won. -Fortunately, Mr. Medal... And at the invitation of the notable consulted inris, we sat down to listen to his opinions. Ledo, it seems to me that it is your "Conttnfia en In nfte. ""

What is your opinion, Mr. Judge, with regard to the imposition of fines for violations of the Prohibitionist law ? -It is my opinion that they should be ! punished according to their economic position and the magnitude of the infraction,'' -Do you have any concrete examples to prove to us the above theory? -Yes, sir.

t Monday morning THE COUNTRY'S PROTEST IS GETTING MORE INTENSE AS THE TIME GUNJTRAHSCURS. - THE BILL HAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE SENATORS TO DEFEND IT.
The Legislature resumes work on Monday at ten o'clock in the morning. The hardest and most difficult work is still ahead. On the one hand, the budget bill, with all its difficulties and concerns. On the other, the inco-me-tax bill, which is currently worrying the whole of Puerto Rico. The bill will be discussed in the Senate on Monday morning. It is expected that the discussion and study of the bill will last at least all day Monday and part of Tuesday, since the Senators, who do not wish in any way to approve an unjust law, and who wish to vote for a sensible and reasonable bill, which has the endorsement of the country, have many amendments in their portfolio.

as approved by the House, has intensified during the last few days. Merchants, farmers, proprietors, settlers, all believe that the bill under these conditions would bring about the reign of the country. i They all ask with much reason for the lowering of the high tax rates imposed by the House, and all hope that the Senate will do justice by heeding the general outcry. i So far, we may be sure that of the 19 Senators, there are not more than five who defend it in all its parts. But the others are there, as the bloc of reason and prudence. The remaining fourteen senators are as firm as on the first day, ready not to vote for the bill if so many amendments are not introduced (Continued on p. 9).

I do not answer personal charges ■ says Mr. Todd, answering the charges made against him by Dr. de Castro I am ready to answer at any time, adminis-trative charges-he adds In our yesterday's edition, we published the accusations made by Dr. de Castro to Mr. Bazan, for not having accepted the presidency of the San Juan Pure Committee before the campaign, because there were no funds and he feared defeat. In the manifestations made by the referred doctor, to our reporter, he formulates charges of political character against the Mayor of San Juan. "The charges that I have against him-he says-are due to the political inconsistency of having forgotten the sacred commitments to those who fought in the campaign, a moral obligation that he should have satisfied before accommodating in the municipal trough people alien to our San Juan collectivity, people who became pure in the last 30 days of the campaign, lukewarm elements in politics.'' An editor of ours visited Mr. Jfpdtk to know the Mayor's answer. When questioned, he replied as follows: ''On this matter I do not intend to answer anything at all; it is not my custom to answer personal charges, but I am willing to answer anyone who makes administrative charges against me.''

Yesterday morning we visited the Palace of Santa Cata-] Ena. to confer with the Hon. Governor of Puerto Rico, on several matters of singular importance, which seem to have lately agitated public comment. After a long wait, Capt. Van Deusen came to advise us that the Chief of Government was willing to receive us. We went to his office, stating to him the reason for our visit in the following form; ON THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL " It has been a matter of general comment-we told him after the routine greetings ■ the removal of Hon. H P Coats as Head of the Department of Justice, especially when the whole country had always seen him seconded in his official work* by the other directors of the Government. Do you know the causes which led to the presidential removal of the above-mentioned gentleman? í - "The matter is so delicate, that I prefer not to make any statement to that effect''.

Are the accusations made by former Attomey General Coats against those who, according to him, by gross intrigues succeeded in removing him from office based or not? -. "I also prefer to adopt the ! most absolute reserve as to i that I do not know why the ex-Attorney ; General Coats has made such ase ve- . rations. He requires me to attend to i the affairs of the Government to the best - j of my ability, without dwelling on ■ what I believe to be my duty ' ' '. And of Mr. Butte's appointment, is it possible that this gentleman has been destined to take the place of his Excellency in the Government of this Island?"-"I have made no judgment on the new Attorney General. President Coolidge knows why he has appointed him. I do not know what political program the said gentleman will carry out. 1 I can only tell you, that ' Mr .
