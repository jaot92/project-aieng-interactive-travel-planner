STATEMENTS! FROM MR. HUYKE
M He is satisfied with the Legislature M
Were all his recommendations heeded M Yesterday we were talking to the Commissioner of Instruction, Mr. Huyke, -Do you think, -we told him, -that with the reduction of appropriations within your budget will instruction in the country suffer anything? -No, sir, it will not suffer at all. It is true that the present budget does not provide for the same number of rural schools as in the last two years; but this indifference will not affect the enrollment, because many of these schools were not opened last year and in others the enrollment was so poor that it was thought advisable to suppress them. However, all the children who were in school last year will find seats in the schools this year. In addition, the reduction in the salary of beginning teachers will always make it possible to open those rural schools which the Department deems indispensable on the island. How will agriculture be taught now? -As you will have seen, the teachers of agriculture are abolished, but the teaching of agriculture in our schools continues in full force. The Department will cause this subject to be given by district inspectors under the immediate direction of our General Superintendent of Agricultu- ! ra. The professional interest of our teachers and inspectors in whom we all have absolute confidence must always be kept in mind. And the labor work? -For the teaching of sewing I am preparing a plan which consists of soliciting help from the municipalities in order to get a bonus for a teacher of the English graduates who work in the town and who wants to do this extra work in its loI quality. I hope to get the sincere cooperation of the school principals of all the towns. (Continued on page 6.)

M Nearly 3 million cut in relation to the previous budget THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER TELLS US WHY HE REDUCED ITEMS M Yesterday morning we were informed at the Santa Catalina Palace that Governor Towner 1 had authorized with his signature the Legislative Budget Bill, after the amendments made to its various items as a result of the studies made on said economic measure by Messrs.

- The mystery with which a local newspaper surrounds an interview between political leaders Don Roberto H. lodd and Don José Tous Soto, in the office of the former, leads our editor to meet with Mayor Puro, who does not seem to attach any importance whatsoever to the interview. "A conversation of friends," he told us. "Nothing political was discussed. -But they say that Tous Soto came with a determined plan," we interrupted. -There is no such thing," Don Roberto answered us, "I was the one who called him myself, for a matter of more interest to him than to me. . Seeing that by that time the Puro line was unassailable, and anxious to confirm the news given by the afternoon paper, we asked him about the famous pa-¡ seo at Condado and Miramar. -That "Lincoln," Don Roberto replied, "has been in a repair shop for about three months. The truth is that I took Tous Soto in my car to his house, because we both had to go to Santurce. Failing again in our intentions, we questioned him in a last effort: "Then, can we affirm that the cigars will not send representatives to the Assembly of the Fusion? The answer was quick and sure: ("As for the Puros of San Juan, they will not be present. That can be stated without fear of being mistaken. * And . . .

M It seems that the ingenuity of young Real, representative of EL MUNDO, in originating the question of the five million deficit of the Insular Government has been salutary and convenient, since it has given cause for certain data and certain numbers, of whose knowledge most of the public was oblivious, to have been i i i given to publicity by the Hon. ¡ Treasurer of Puerto Rico. j I repeat again to Mr. Gallardo i I that I have not fought him and i have so confessed publicly. He is but one-sixth of what may be called the Insular Government, and yet he pretends to be a part of it, and yet he is a part of it. So the interview was of no political consequence whatsoever. Everything remains as it was. It cannot even be said that Don Roberto and Tous Soto have repeated the classic embrace of Muñoz Rivera and Barbosa, for unlike the two extinct caudillos, they have always maintained a sincere and cordial friendship.

HEN THE FEDERAL COURT RESUMES SITTING ■ X
M The Hun. Ira K. Wells returns to Sao uao ivr
OFFICIAL SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT TERM M This morning returns to this capital the Hon. Federal Short Judge Ira K. Wells, who is to resume the sessions of said court of justice. Judge Wells has been spending the recess period agreed by the court in Aibonito, where he stayed in the company of his family. SESSION PERIOD Yesterday morning we were ini formed in the Federal District Attorney's Office, that as soon as the Judge returns on Saturday morning i will begin to see different cases i pending consideration before the court. SESSION IN PONCE i Soon the Federal Court will move to Ponce to hold trial in numerous cases that occurred in the Southern District of the Island. This practice followed by the aforementioned Court of Justice considerably facilitates the general work, alleviating to a great extent the difficulties that arise when the proceedings are considered in San Juan, where all those directly and indirectly connected with the case must travel to this city. CASES FOR TODAY. Prosecutors Gay and Gonzalez are activating the legal briefs of numerous proceedings which were entrusted to them before the short recess of sessions of the Federal Court was ordered. 1222 Try never to forget this number. Ask for it whenever you want to sell, buy, lease or rent something. We will take care of the rest.-P.
