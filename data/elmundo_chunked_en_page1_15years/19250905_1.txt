THE NEW HIPPIC GOMISION AND THE GOATS MR. RICHARDSON WILL NOW BE TAKEN INTO PRACTICE _M- Quite a lot of dii nero.-Legal authorization M For some days past the new Island Equestrian Comi1 sion has been in office. The public is anxiously awaiting the proceedings of the new body, to determine whether it is to give it its confidence as heretofore, or whether on the contrary it is to initiate protest. The Governor has brought new elements to the new Commission, and the public wishes to know if they really have plans to improve the equestrian sport in Puerto Rico. In any case, for now, the optimistic note prevails. I THE PROBLEM OF ' THE GOATS AND THE NEW COMMISSION The most serious evil from which the equestrian sport suffers in our island is undoubtedly the introduction of "goats" that put in graContinued on page 5 SEMILLA Df CEBOLLAS Legítima de Canarias and of the white-yellow class have just received it and sell it guaranteeing its geri mination.

One hundred and fifty ex- . policemen in serious conflict M They are left out of the i budget M Not a phrase of hope from the Executive " M Recently it was said that he Ledo. A. N.

The budget which was voted by the legislature and which contained an endowment of $8,000 to increase the Retirement or Relief Fund which exists in the Treasury in favor of pensioners; this endowment has been eliminated by the Governor of Puerto Rico, and of course, no one else could have done it. Against this elimination, and for the purpose of having the endowment included in the budget, the pensioners formed a block and went yesterday to the Governor, accompanied by myself, as attorney, to express to him the injustice and inconvenience of the situation, and to express to him the injustice and inappropriateness of the pensioner's pension. | Leary Streets; very near the Park and traffic.

PUERTO RICO AT THE HEAD OF THE WORLD Ü (R1NINALITY Twenty times more murders in the P. R. than in London Puerto Rico is at the head of the civilized nations of the world as far as crime is concerned. This is shown by the report presented by Colonel Lewis to Governor Towner. The number of murders committed last year in Puerto Rico is about four times as great as that of London and, proportionately to the populations of' both places, more than twenty times as great. Neither Paris, nor Berlin, nor New York itself can compare with our island. In tomorrow's Sunday edition we will devote a full page to a clear and detailed exposition of a problem of such transcendence for our life as a people, in the hope that an effort will be made to remedy this alarming state of affairs. How crime in the great capitals of the world pales in comparison to that of Puerto Rico is the subject that is discussed with reliable documentation and exact numbers. Anyone interested in situations that concern us so directly should not fail to learn about these facts that we expose.
LAST HOUR M VIOLENT FIRE ON ALEEN STREET M Two children and six firemen asphyxiated - Firemen, police and militia are fighting hard to subdue the ravenous element.
At 5:45 yesterday afternoon ¡ a violent fire broke out in the four-story building owned by Dr. del Valle Sárraga, located at 88 Alien Street, and in the premises occupied by "Los Dependientes'', in which is installed a pro- age furniture store of the reputable merchants of this square Messrs. "P. Gon- í zález & Co.''' The smoke coming from the mezzanine of the second floor increased by the minute, causing the natural alarm among the neighborhood, which was rushing to vacate the houses threatened by the fire. The firemen, who were immediately alerted to the fire, were immediately called to the fire, and the firemen, who were immediately alerted to the fire, were immediately called to the fire, and the firemen, who were immediately alerted to the fire, were immediately alerted to the fire.
The fire department, which seemed to be increasing in the back part of the furniture store, was deployed throughout the main floors of the building, trying to locate the fire, which seemed to be increasing in the back part of the furniture store. The fire chief, Mr. Alonso, penetrating through the rear of the building, succeeded with a party of men at his orders, fighting with the thick smoke, to place the first man- ! mo. THE AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ORDER The Colonel of the Insu lar Police Mr. Lewis appeared at the site of the fire, accompanied by Captains Blanco and Berreteaga, and Chief McManus, in command of more than thirty police and detectives. Traffic was cut off for two blocks along the entire length of the street, while the police made efforts to contain the large crowd that had gathered at the intersections. The building in which the fire had taken place, which is of reinforced concrete, seemed in the first moments to have withstood without danger the severe test to which it was subjected by the 11aI mas. However, as the police were (Continued on page 3)

GRAVE MOTIN IN A BALL GAME M NUMEROUS PEOPLE ARE INJURED M Many people are reported to the police - M With great frequency, heated arguments arise in our "base-ball" challenges on the occasion of the games, which sometimes turn into a brawl and even a riot. And in this case, while a baseball challenge was being held in Coamo, in the San Ildefonso neighborhood, a brawl broke out that culminated in a serious riot due to the numerous per sena? - that took part in the fight, which could have had serious consequences if it had not been for the intervention of the police, who as always lived up to their just reputation. STONES AND REVOLVERS. The argument that motivated the mo-' 1 tin, gave room for revolvers to come to the fore and others armed themselves with stones to defend themselves. The protagonists of this bloody episode were the individuals ¡ Pedro Pérez, who according to police reports was armed with a revolver, Santiago and Cándido Pérez, armed with stones, and the ball players Julio Alomar, José Antonio Vega, ¡ Emilio Hernández and many others - whose names do not appear in the police file.
