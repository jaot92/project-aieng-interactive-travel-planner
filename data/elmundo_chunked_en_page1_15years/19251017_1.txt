Alonso replies to remarks by Speaker M
- He does not explain the arguments against statehood 1 " # ACCUSES MR. TOUS SOTO OF WALKING TO INDEPENDENCE M Apparently the social leaders do not agree with the latest statements of Mr. José Tous Soto in relation to statehood. In our columns yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Tous Soto, affirmed that Puerto Rico was not asking to sustain the burdens that the American Constitution imposed on the States and that therefore we could not face statehood. And as is natural, the distinguished politician went into detail, tending to prove the truth of his assertion. Representative at-large, Mr. Alonso, Minority Leader, with whom we were speaking yesterday morning, made the following statements to that effect: ARGUMENTING "The Speaker of the House, (Continued on p. ti.) puts to act in line with those ideas in the executive session of the Senate in February. | BUT IF... However, even though Senator Zeno has not visited Fortaleza, we know from a confidential source that Senator Martínez Dávila has, and that he has defended the Alianza candidate and his district to the Governor. In the meantime, the discussion continues and it is still expected that the Executive will decide at any moment and put an end to the judicial combination with this last appointment.

6UA-' YAMA'S JUDGE BRINGS 6RAN DISCUSSION
- M a SENATOR ZENO DOESN'T VISIT but his colleague Martínez Dávila does M As we can see, the judicial combination is becoming endless, since the position of District Judge of Guayama is still in litigation, a position for which so many candidates have emerged that in reality it is difficult for the Executive to make a proper selection. Naturally, in cases of this nature, which so directly affect the interests of an entire district, there are always conflicting criteria, and there is always the fear of incurring in a regrettable error in making the appointment. In addition, it seems that there is a desire to avoid the emergence of protests by the affected senators, as in the case of Humacao, which has given rise to the protest of the senators for that district, Mr. Fuertes and Mr. González Fagundo. What is certain is that a great discussion has arisen regarding the position of District Judge of Guayama, and it is even said that the appointment was made in favor of a certain candidate and that a certain protest has imposed a new delay. THE SENATORS AFFECTED BY THE APPOINTMENT As we all know, the senators directly affected by this appointment are Don Francisco M. Zeno and Ledo. Manuel A. Martínez Dávila. We know because it is known to us, that ej serrador Zeno does not go to Fortaleza and that he has made a direct recommendation to the Governor in favor of this or that candidate, even though he has his own ideas in relation to this question and is dis-' "The trade injunctions are not in favor of this or that candidate.

M THUS STATES A YOUNG JURIST OF THIS CAPITAL BELIEVES THAT U LEDO. BROWN HAS TAKEN A WRONG PATH M Knowing that the Ledo. Aitu ro O'Neill, has made an extensive study of the debated Sales Act, we thought that he would have something interesting to tell us about the injunction proceedings now pending in the Federal Circuit against the validity of the Act, and we decided to call on him and obtain his opinion on a matter of such vital interest. Lcdb. O'Neill, acceding to our requests, expressed himself as follows: "For a portion of time past, as soon as it was enacted I obtained a copy of faith (Continued on p. 5) " i 1 others. And I leave you in no doubt that the governing body of the Alliance will resolve as best suits the interests of the country. "It is my opinion, however, that if it waits until the merger has been effected it will be for the sole purpose of carrying a firm and decided direction of the program to be pursued in Washington. Notwithstanding this argument, we have on the other hand Resolution No. 6 dé! I Mr. Tous Soto as well as the Board of Directors of the Alliance. But everything will have to be settled satisfactorily. Even though Representative Cumpiano did not have to confess to him and we know that he will be one of the legislators who will go on the commission to Washington, since he has the absolute confidence of the heads of the political group to which he belongs.

SPEAKS REP. MR. CUMPIANO
M COMMENTING ON THE SENDING OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE M THE RESOLUTION OF MR. TOUS SOTO M In making our visit to Fortaleza yesterday we .met with the distinguished representative to the House, Ledo. Cesar Cumpiano and we took the opportunity to ask him a few questions regarding the political moment and the legislative committee that will go to Washington to demand greater freedoms for our island. Our readers know that Rep. Cumpiano was the author of the resolution introduced in the House several months ago for the full Legislature to go to Washington to work in defense of the elected governor's bill and other libertarian measures. We asked him: "I couldn't tell you yet," we said. "I couldn't tell you yet," he replies. "I have very important matters in the pipeline and if by that time I have not sanctioned them in one form or another I could not go, though I should be very sorry to do so. I still don't know who will be part of the commission - "We could not yet specify exactly the names of the legislators who will be part of the commission. Naturally, we already know of certain representatives and senators who will undoubtedly have to go, since the triumph of our cause demands it, but as I said before, it is not yet possible to give a complete list of the commissioners. Do you believe that the commission will go to Washington before or after the merger? "We do not know yet, since there are different criteria in this regard. From fire that to resolve such an important question it will be necessary for the Board of Directors to meet and hear the arguments of some and others, and to hear the arguments of others.

THE MANDAMUS AT THE SUPREME
M The Governor was not officially notified THE SCRUTINY WILL COME IMMEDIATELY M Finally the day before yesterday, at two o'clock in the afternoon, was vip before the Supreme Court the Mandamus on appeal filed by Lcab. Bolivar Pagan against Gov. Towner, to obtain the appointment by writ of mandamus of the proprietary member of the Insular Board of Elections. The Supreme Court was packed to overflowing with the public, especially socialist republicans, who were eager to know the decision of the justices. i The Ledo. Bolívar Pagán appeared on his own behalf and Attorney General Butte appeared as amicus curiae", for reasons that we will explain later. What is certain is that Dr. Butte's presence aroused the interest of the public, who expected him to report before the Supreme Court justices. But this did not happen. THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT NOT NOTIFIED AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE, we repeat, because of the coincidence, truly unfortunate for the appellant, that the Governor TowI ner was not duly notified of the appeal to the Supreme Court. | Therefore, it was impossible for the Attorney General to speak if his defendant had not yet been notified of the appeal. Bolivar Pagan went on for more than an hour, citing copious jurisprudence in support of his claims. THE COURT RESERVES THE RULING | However, after hearing the case, the Court reserved its ruling, which will be released in due course. This has made the anxiety on the part of the Interested Parties even more intense. If, due to the fact that the Governor was not notified of the appeal, the Hon. Supreme Court should decide* that the petition has no place, then we have reason to believe that the Ledo- Bolivar Pa-' I gán will file his appeal again on November 2, date on which we are informed that the said high court will meet again in ordinary session. If, on the other hand, it is decided otherwise, whatever it may be, then there is no doubt that the scrutiny will not be delayed any longer and that the opening of the disputed parcels will begin in earnest.

A number of M coins appear in the Capitol.
These are pesos me-jicanos.-Gold? M-THE COMMENTS BEGIN.-WORKERS IN ACTION M There are still those on our island who believe wholeheartedly that burials exist and that the dead still come out at midnight, who place fabulous treasures in our hands. But generally one begins to consider as a perfect ini genuo the one who sustains those ideas so little in consonance with the prose of this century of struggle and effort, in which we can expect very little from chance because the rude comi petenc.'a that we do to each other does not allow it. i And in spite of that GREAT QUANTITY OF IN THE CAPITOLIO I J The workers that render their services in the works of the Cap tolio, when carrying out certain excavations, have found - as we are informed, - a great quantity ¡ of Mexican pesos, that being of silver are perfectly well conserved. We are also told that these Mexican coins have been distributed among the workers and that a certain continent has about ninety of them. 4. The fact that this money has appeared, in such an unexpected way, has given rise to the workers thinking that further on there are even greater quantities of coins and there is no lack of qtuéfi "pete con anxiety that at a given moment the golden lode that made us dream so much when we were children leapt before their eyes. The workers have spoken of nothing but burials and even the famous bandit Cofres!

I Speaker was in Santa Catalina and conferred with Governor Towner in relation to the business of the day, which, as is nai tural given his political position, directly affects and interests him. * M THE MEETING OF THE 'j DIRECTORIO As the Board of Directors is due to meet at any moment, although the exact date has not been fixed, it is expected that Mr. Tous Soto will have conferred yesterday with Mr. Barceló to settle this important point. I As is known, the Directorate, at its last session held, left it in the hands of both heads of the Alliance to agree when, in their opinion, the said organization should meet again to resolve the very important political issues that are pending final resolution and that have the attention of the whole country focused on them. I And therefore from one moment to another it is expected that an extra meeting will be publicly announced (Oentinúa in the pSg. a.| ' 1 has come up for discussion, in view of the possibility that it is 1 of a hidden treasure precisely where the new Island Chapter is being built, which, by the way, is well advanced and is already beginning to present a truly important aspect with its white marble walls.
