THE PTO. RICO DRUG APPEALS FROM A JUDGMENT IHPUESTALE
M SELE HAD BEEN FINED $15,000 M Coty powder was not in its possession. - M In reporting in our newspaper on the $15,000 fine imposed on Porto Rico Drug by the Federal Court, we made an unintentional mistake in referring to one of the details that constitutes precisely the strong point on which the important firm centralizes its defense. Mr. Siegmund did not take any boxes of Coty powder from Porto Rico Drug, but from three other pharmacists who say they obtained them from that importer. In order that everything may be duly clarified, we publish the attentive letter addressed to us to that effect: 8r. Director of EL MUNDO, San Juan, city. Dear Sir: I have read in your newspaper EL MUNDO, issue of October 29, an editorial article, referring to the case recently heard before the Federal Court, vs. the Porto Rico Drug Co., and as I observe that it is in error in the part that corresponds to the statement made by Mr. Siegmund in this case, I must clarify that the informant of that esteemed publication alters the facts, stating precisely the opposite of what the said Mr. Siegmund stated before the Court. Mr. Siegmund stated in plain language and free from any alleged interpretations, that he had not found a single ca- I ja of Coty Powders, marked "Ma- 1 de in France" in the warehouses of the Porto Rico Drug Co. after a strict and meticulous search, to the last corner of the Company's premises. What Mr. Siegmund found in the possession of the Porto Rico Drug Co. was only, Cotv Powders with ' the stamp "U. S. Coty Co.

THE CAPTAIN OF THE SCHOONER "CATALINA" GIVES SIGNS OF LIFE
I - - M SENT A RADIOGRAPHIC DISPATCH TO THE CONSIGNATORY HOUSE M All is lost, including the money.- The crew. M A few days ago we published a report announcing that the Dominican government had sent an official communication to its consuls in Puerto Rico, reporting the mysterious disappearance of the schooner "Catalina", carrying on board a large amount of cash and a large cargo, and requesting the Dominican consuls that if the schooner entered one of our ports, it should be immediately detained pending further orders. THE CAPTAIN GIVES SIGNS OF LIFE The "Listín Diario", which has recently reached this office, brings new information related to this same matter, to the effect that the Captain of the schooner "Catalina" is finally giving signs of life and has addressed a radiographic message to the Agent of the Government in Santo Domingo, Mr. Juan B. Laríl, explaining the reason for his mysterious disappearance. THE CAPTAIN'S VERSION. j Captain Gonzalez explains what happened as follows: In- : form that his schooner was lashed : í by a strong storm, which finally- : : mind the completely dismantled "Catalina" managed to save herself from shipwreck by arriving at ■ the Venezuelan coasts where she is : found. The Captain also adds that the schooner's cargo was thrown into the water, as the storm was so strong that it was necessary to resort to all resources to avoid the shipwreck. What the Captain does not explain in his adiographic dispatch is whether he also threw into the water the heavy barrel containing a large amount of money sent by the Royal BAC of Canada to the Central Romana. The Captain and owner of the Dominican schooner "Perla del Oza1 ma'/* which was in our port yesterday has informed that the entire crew of the "Catalina" is Venezuelan, that is, citizens of the nation on whose shores they have arrived. | BEAUTIFUL FLAT in front of the "Auxilio Mutuo" " 1 is for rent.

CONTRIBUTION ARTICLES
On our eighth page today appear two collaborative articles. One is by Ledo. Pedro Santana Jr. on "Legislar ón Obrera" and the other by Don Domingo Piofanetti regarding the "Refaccionario". As the one is a member of the Workers' Compensation Committee and the other a wealthy coffee grower, we have no doubt that they will shed new light on these matters. NEW POLITICAL COMMISSION TO . WASHINGTON M IS NOT CONNECTED WITH ANY PARTY M It will develop an opposition policy. M- -- News has reached us which we receive with the necessary reserve and which we give only as information, in the hope that later events themselves will allow us to be more explicit. i Enough of this preamble. A NEW POLITICAL COMMISSION. The fact is that well-informed people have approached us to tell us in a low voice that preparations are already being made to send to Washington a new political commission, which has its own plans and whose trip to the North is due to very special reasons.

¡3ÍI FL PRES. OF THE ASSOCIA CION DE TAHONEROS SALTA A LA ARENA __M The fear of the mills is not explained. The President of the Association of Tahoneros de Puerto Rico, Mr. Miguel Ruiz Soler, makes the following statements in relation to the debated question of flour analysis: "In the issue of EL MUN>DO corresponding to Tuesday 27th of this year there is an article by Mr. Fernando Moret refuting the statements that I made to an editor of this newspaper in my capacity as a miller. I would like to reply briefly to the points made by Mr. Moret in my capacity as President of the Tahoneros Association, on the occasion of the resolutions passed at the Maya Güez meeting, demanding that the milling houses sell their hr riñas on the basis of a chemical analysis. I wish to answer briefly the essential points on which Mr. Moret asserts in his reply. It is erroneous to say that Puerto Rican tahone ros produce ha riñas of interior qualities for the achievement of low prices. Mr. Moret knows that we have always been reluctant to use new brands of those that flood the market daily, precisely because, lacking the means to verify their quality, we are afraid of being misled by the abundant lip service of some agents who do not skimp on the enconuázS# l (Continued on page K. > ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ''.

THIS MINORITY UNDERSTANDING WOULD CARRY A NEW NAME M The platform should be feasible for all. M The merger which is planned between the Republicans and the Allies is intended to serve as an example of an understanding which is now being planned by the Socialist and Republican minorities. However, before taking such an important step, the Senate: Santiago Iglesias hopes that certain difficulties which have existed since the last elections will be settled. The continuous dissidences which may have been kept secret between the first and the second political side, will give rise to a very important conference to be held soon by Messrs. Iglesias and Martínez Na dal. The field is now fertile for a union such as the one planned, and it is believed that never have the minorities been in better conditions to unite in a solid bloc and make their forces felt. A NEW NAME The name to be given to the merger between Socialists and pure Republicans has been discussed on various occasions. Even the alliance itself has had difficulty in finding a name for its merger, and no agreement has been reached. -Some seda listen se rc- ' Continued on page 2 1
THE DESOLATION- I ¡ IN BULGARIA
VI EN A, October 30, (United Press).-The Bulgarians have already reoccupied their areas, as the Greeks have definitely withdrawn behind the frontier. Thousands of families who fled in panic fearing to be victims of the Greek troops, upon retaking their relatives, are crying in despair since they have only found ruins where they left their homes. Desolation is rife in Bulgaria, with many families in abject poverty as a result of the conflict that has arisen. THE MAYOR OF S A N JUAN' R.

PROTEST ARISES AGAINST THE RE-ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS.
FARMERS ARE VERY ALARMED M The situation will be formally raised with the Executive. M The news that property in Puerto Rico will be subject to an official revaluation, in order to increase our borrowing capacity, has fallen like a bombshell among taxpayers. We are following the movement closely and we know that the taxpaying class in our island is getting ready to do battle, for reasons that we will explain later on. We also know that the protest has its base in the agricultural centers of our island, a protest that has been seconded by the fruit growers, coffee growers, tobacco growers, and sugar producers. In general terms, the taxpayers of Puerto Rico do not accept the new assessment and are prepared to do everything in their power to prevent the Treasury Department's plans from being carried out. MONDAY'S ASSEMBLY We will begin by saying that Monday's great assembly in the capital, which will be attended by sugar producers, farmers, tobacco growers, fruit growers, coffee growers, etc., has as one of its main topics the news that property will be subject to a new tax by means of an increase in the assessment. It seems that those affected by the project are getting ready to unite, convinced that in this way they will be able to get a new tax increase. OFFICE OF THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE M NOTICE M On this date I have placed for collection the PROPERTY tax receipts for the fiscal year 1925-26. It is reminded that if these are not satisfied in a timely manner, I will proceed to collection in accordance with Article 335 of the Political Code. San Juan. Puerto Rico, October 31, 1925. B. T.

LEADERS ARRIVE FOR THE i DIRECTOR'S MEETING.
M-TOUS SOTO WILL BE IN SAN JUAN ON MONDAY M The meeting will begin on Monday. M- The meeting of the Board of Directors should begin immediately, since the Governor is waiting for the minutes of this political body to leave for Washington, the leaders of the alliance have begun to arrive in this capital. The meeting will begin, according to the reports we have had, next Monday, when the trip of the Pro Puerto Rico Commission will be discussed first. It is believed that there are so many problems to be solved that the meeting will continue for at least three consecutive days. i BEFORE OR AFTER? Should the Pro Puerto Rico Commission go to Washington before or after the Fusionist Assembly? Who will define the policy before the national authorities or the Puerto Rican Commissioners, the Alliance Board of Directors, or the Fusionist Assembly itself? This will be duly resolved by the Board of Directors of the AsarrVtm, and it is believed that it will be resolved by the Board of Directors drawing up the policy of the Pro-Puerto Rican Commission or by the assembly.
