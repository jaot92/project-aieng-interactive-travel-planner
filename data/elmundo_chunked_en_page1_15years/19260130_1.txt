PAYMENT WAS MADE TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO.
IT WAS DUE TO A CONFERENCE HELD WITH THE GOVERNOR BY THE KNOWN FINANCIER From that interview came the extraordinary session of the Board of Directors of the Association.
As our readers may recall, the Board of Directors of the Sugar Producers' Association, in one of its last meetings, agreed that the sugar growers should pay their taxes, basing the resolution on the fact that an understanding could be reached with the Legislature, so that it could attend to several amendments that they intend to request to the approved tax laws. The Governing Body of the Association unanimously approved this resolution. As to the unanimity of the other associates, that is another matter. We have continued to inquire about this matter this month, wishing to know what motives the leaders of the sugar element had for adopting this attitude, which has been THE CATHEDRATIC OF FRENCH AT THE UNIVERSITY WENT CRAZY - M - _ He was confined yesterday in the island's Ma nicomio. M The event has caused great consternation in university circles. M - Yesterday morning we saw that" a car stopped in front of the Insular Ma nicomio. In it came a professor of the University of Puerto Rico, Dr. Saliva, a doctor of the University, and Oabo Rojas who serves in that institution. We asked for details about the purpose of the trip, but were not informed of anything. We immediately contacted the Director of the Asylum, and were told that a professor from the University, Monsieur Conlon, Professor of French, had been admitted to the institution. When the school year began, Dr. Benner found it necessary to hire a new professor of French, since the one who was holding that chair was forced to leave our island. It was then that Professor Coulon, a graduate of the "JJniversidad" (Continued on p. 6, 6th. col.), came to our island.
This was a source of great comment in our political, administrative and legislative circles. Don Eduardo Giorgetti, a few days ago held an extensive interview with Governor Towner. From this interview came the meeting of the Board of Directors of the "Sugar Producers Association", where it was agreed that they should pay their contributions, as a conciliatory measure. Mr. Eduardo Biorgetti has complied with the agreement of the Board of Directors of the "Sugar Producers' Association", since in the last three days he has paid to the Treasury a large part of the contributions he owed to the government, including those related to the retroactive income tax. THE PURE LOCAL COMMITTEE DISPOSES OF EMPRESTITE M WORKS JOBS Has addressed letter to fc>s Subcommittees soliciting candidates. Division of posts to be made for Republicans and Socialists. M The works that the municipality begins to build as soon as it has the two and a half million dollars corresponding to the new loan, will give work to an immense number of coalitionists. Needless to say that not all those who hope to get a job are pure socialists or republicans. There are hundreds and hundreds, of all parties, who will create a situation equal to that of the inauguration of Port Arthur. By force, many must be displeased. But, in order to avoid unfair recommendations, party leaders are already taking precautions.

SENATOR MARTINEZ DAVILA FIGHTS POSSIBLE SALARY CUTS
HE BELIEVES THAT IF THE BUDGET REDUCTION IS IMPOSED, THE LEAST NECESSARY EMPLOYEES MAY BE ELIMINATED "Those who do not have their domestic problems solved cannot perform efficient work". M
Although several gentlemen who are part of the Economic Conference have affirmed that this organization has never thought of proposing to reduce the salaries of public employees, * l as one of the means to reduce the budget, however, this rumor continues to be accentuated, and on several occasions we have been questioned on the matter. We have asked the opinion of distinguished legislators, wishing to know their opinion on this point. We visited Senator Martínez Dávila, and when referring to this matter, he stated the following: "I do not believe that the Economic Conference has conceived such an idea. My personal opinion is that the budget can be readjusted without having to resort to this measure. Many employees whose services are not essentially necessary can easily be eliminated. To lower the salaries of men who do efficient work, is to impose upon them to live in tremendous suffering, in tremendous worry, for they will scarcely be able to attend to their most urgent needs." ♦ "He will not be able to work calmly, 1 ' he will not be able to do his duty who has to think of his misery.

to his domestic problem, he will not be able to perform efficient labor, however intelligent he may be." "Competent men we need, skillful men, skilled, trained, prepared, free from great worries. If the Government is only to be able to offer a miserable renumeration to its employees, it will undoubtedly go to failure. There is a more frank, more desirable way: reduce the number of employees, especially by eliminating those who are least necessary. That is my opinion." THE MUNICIPAL ASSEMBLY SUBMITS TO AUCTION THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AQUEDUCTION The Layne house has its proposition ready. In accordance with the provisions of the law regarding the construction of public works at a cost of more than $600, the City Council is prepared to put the construction of a new water supply for the city up for bid. The manner in which the bids are to be submitted will be made public at one time or another. A GROUP OF ENGINEERS A group of engineers of this city has a proposal to supply the city with water. The engineer Mr. Nones is in charge of it. They propose to use the volume of the Bayamón and Guayna bo rivers by means of the construction of dams, as well as to use the water of the Bayamón and Guayna bo rivers.

MONSIGNOR 0 A - RUANA ARRIVES IN SANJUANEE MONDAY
M WILL BE 'RECEIVED BY THE HELES AT THE QUAY M There is a possibility that Cardinal Doughberty may come later. -m- Monsignor Caruana, Bishop of the Diocese of San Juan, absent from our island for several months in performance of a special mission entrusted by the Holy See, will arrive in our capital on Monday morning, aboard the steamship "San Lorenzo". Monsignor has visited different South American countries, has seen the Italian capital, has had a prolonged audience with His Holiness, the Pope, and finally returns to his Diocese, via New York. Bishop Byrne was expected to return to his Diocese via New York. Bishop Byrne, Bishop of the Pontifical Diocese of Ceylon, was expected to come with Bishop Caruana, but this was not possible, judging from the information supplied to us by the Bishopric, as well as Bishop Vicar Garcia, of the Pearl of the South. This is due, in the opinion of the ecclesiastical authorities, to the fact that Monsignor Byrne has to resolve important matters in the North before embarking for Puerto Rico. In addition, there is a strong possibility that Monsignor Byrne will be accompanied by Cardinal Dougbberty, who for some time has been anxious to visit the island. To receive Monsignor Caruana at the pier on Monday will go the clergy, the Knights of Columbus, and various religious congregations. e. THREE NEWS FROM PARIS M Work has begun on the monument to be erected to Sarah Bernhardt. The name of Anatele France has been given to one of the streets and a statue of Ronsard has been placed at the French College. t THE LAYNE HOUSE WILLING TO LEAD On the other hand the Layne House, as stated in our yesterday's edition by the resident engineer Mr. Casals, is ready to lead. It will present its proposal for subway wells, giving the municipality all kinds of guarantees.

THE WORK DEVELOPED IN PUERTO RICO BY THE "ACADEMY OF SCIENCES" OF NEW YORK M a- WHAT THE ECOLOGICAL STUDY BEING CARRIED OUT IMPLIES FOR OUR FARMERS. M- Exchanging impressions* with Dr. Britton, Director of the "Botanical Garden".
The work being done in Puerto Rico by the "Academy of Sciences" of New York, is a great enterprise, deserving of our most fervent praise. Until now Puerto Rico did not possess such an extensive and varied reía', te of its natural history, that reus' cando the evidence of the past and studying species of extinct Flora and prehistoric Fauna, would give us the guidelines to follow for the future, opening new possibilities in the field of science. The study of this last subdivision of ecology is of incalculable value for Puerto Rico, which, being almost entirely an agrarian country, needs a systematic and scientific source of information that can, in a precise manner, serve as a basis for the promotion of our agriculture in accordance with the most recent research in 1" science. So much so, that the Department of Agriculture and Labor, recognizing this conclusion, is lending its support to the
The Department of Agriculture and Labor, recognizing this conclusion, is lending its valuable assistance, not only monetarily but with the personal cooperation of Commissioner Chardon, who in Volume VT1I of "THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS" presents a conscientious study of the "Ideology" of the country. The primary object of the commission which has just arrived on our island is the completion of such an important work which is being printed under the auspices of the "New York Academy of Science''.
