At a recent session of 1* Municipal Assembly which we attended- ■ timos, the said Company addressed a letter to the Assembly relating to the aqueduct works. The Mayor, Mr. Todd, felt it his duty to write a reply to the aforesaid Company, a letter which we published a short time ago, stating that the acceptance in principle of the Layne project did not entitle him to assume the position in which they were placed. The. Layne in turn replied to this letter from the Mayor,* a reply which we also published in our columns. The incident has not passed from . there, but we wishing to give our readers the < last pala- , bra of Mayor Todd, so far as /this matter is concerned, visited his . offices in the afternoon yesterday. We publish below the interview that took place: Don Roberto-do you have anything to answer to the Layne's last letter, we asked. -Absolutely nothing. I consider the incident over. I proceeded in accordance with what is required of me by the position I held: Our duty, in this case was, as I have told you on another occasion, to proceed with a lead foot since it is a matter of such importance.

THE SLUDGE. ORTIZ ALIBRAN ARGUES THAT THE TREASURER MUST COMPLY WITH THE LAW.
- ! CLAIMS THAT THE ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE MADE ON THE EXEMPLOYED PROPERTY But he believes that the de rigueur exemptions should be granted. M Yesterday we received a phone call from Lodo. Ortiz Alibrán, to tell us that he had seen in EL MUNDO an information, where it was assured that it was intended to change the procedure for the appraisal of cor- porationsA The distinguished lawyer indicated that it was good for us to clarify that his client, the "Porto Rico and American Insurance Co," did not really intend to change the F1 procedure, but that what he wanted was to make the Treasurer of Puerto ! Rico to comply strictly with the law, as it had been doing since the implementation of the "Hollander" law, a system that was varied, according to Licúo's statements. Or tiz Alibrán a few years ago by the Treasury Department. "Substantially," says the well-known counsel, "what the plaintiff in this case, and in my judgment the other corporations that are pursuing analogous lawsuits, are requesting, is that the value of their real and tangible personal property be paid, eliminating from all valuation the property that is expressly exempted by law. "For example, now the Treasurer, under the pretext of appraising the capital stock of corporations, includes in that appraisal Liberty bonds and other federal and insular obligations which are exempted by law." So much for Ledo's statements. Ortiz Alibrán. We are pleased to publish them, since they expand on our information of yesterday.

CLAIMS THAT A JUDGMENT HAS BEEN RENDERED CONTRARY TO THE PRO-.
PIOUS PRECEDENTS ISSUED BY THE COURT "Why not continue to uphold principles that until now seemed unchanging?" he says. M The decision recently handed down by the Supreme Court in the much talked about case of Bolivar Pagan v. Governor Towner, has been the subject of diverse and opposing comments, and has been the talk of the town. s Hon. Carlos Franco Soto, Associate Justice of the Court, not in agreement with the criterion sustained in this case by the other colleagues of the Court, has rendered an extensive dissenting opinion in the case of Bolivar Pagan. dissenting opinion in which he discusses at great length the very important issues involved in this transcendental lawsuit, and reaches truly sensational conclusions referring to the interpretation given by the majority of the Supreme Court to the laws and jurisprudence involved in the case. The Hon. Franco Soto argues that the Court should have issued the alternative writ of "man requested by the Ledo. Bolivar T*agan, on behalf of the Socialist Party'." He argues 'idearás that already the same Supreme Court in previous cited cases has held that the Governor of Puerto Rico may be compelled to perform a ministerial act impuéstole by law. The cases cited in this regard, and which it is suggested the other justices forgot, were two cases followed against Governors Post and Reily. The dissenting judge further contends that to ignore Bolivar Pagan's claim in this case is tantamount to declaring that the island Legislature had no purpose in enacting the election law, nor does it have any purpose in the other laws.

I SO INFORMED US THIS ULTI- ■ MU YESTERDAY- HOWEVER, THERE IS NO . T YET A FINAL RESOLUTION M
M "THE ECONOMIC CONFERENCE WILL SUPPRESS ' INNECESSARY POSITIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT" M---- "But it has never attempted to lower the salaries of the employees". - M
n The Economic Conference dn, plenary, has commissioned two of itsl > members: Don Antonio R. BarceI ló and Don Luis Venegas, to draft a plan to amend the "Income Tax" , and Sales laws. Yesterday morning we visited Mr. Venegas, wishing to know what steps have been taken to date by him and Mr. Barceló in this regard. Barceló in this respect. We were courteously received by the President of the "Bankers' Association of Puerto Rico", stating the following: "Actually, we have not yet entered fully into the mission entrusted to us, however, the idea of reducing the tax rate at present in force prevails among us. "The intense work that weighs upon us, has not allowed us to devote ourselves to this arduous and delicate task that has been imposed upon us, nevertheless, Mr. Barceló and I have exchanged impressions in this respect, and I believe that we will agree to recommend the lowering of the acflial rate." THE NEW BUDGET "Mr. Ddmenech is not yet Sá fully restored, and, Rábido to this the Committee which is' *" j day the present budget in order to adjust the go- j ' hierno's expenses to the income, has not been able , to continue its labors. But you may rest assured, that it has never been the intention of the men composing the Economic Conference, to lower the salaries of the em- I picates. It is only an attempt to simplify the system of island government, making it both economical and efficient. The island administration requires the services of competent, prepared men. In order to obtain them, it is necessary that they be reasonably remunerated. Now yes: the Economic Conference will eliminate several unnecessary positions in services that in, nothing would benefit us if they were suppressed. All superfluous expenditure, all impractical allocations will be cancelled.
IVI i tica will be cancelled, understanding that only in this way will we be able to alleviate our difficult economic situation. THE $30,000,000,000 BORROWING - ' I believe, that there will be no difficulty in getting this loan from the central government, if we explain clearly our situation, and our purposes to the American Congress. It is all in the hands of the United States that we are willing to lend our cooperation. When we tried to consolidate our island debt, we had in mind the present economic crisis of the country, We will save a good deal of money". "We yearn for progress for Puer to Rico, but we justly understand that it is impossible to continue this mad rush for progress by compromising our economic well-being. Let us progress yes, but not by wanting to do it by leaps and bounds, because in reality we cannot afford it. Gradually, according to the circumstances, we will be in a position to reach a remarkable impulse, without having ouc sustain an open struggle with -our financial future." ASSESSMENT PLAN "However patriotic a man may be, he is often reluctant to pay his contributions, he notices that in o# procedure used some injustice may be involved. With the new appraisal plan of Mr. Landrón, the protests will diminish, since it is formulated on a scientific basis. There will be no opportunity for arbitrary and capricious appraisals, and the Board of Equalization and Review will have to consider far fewer cases.
