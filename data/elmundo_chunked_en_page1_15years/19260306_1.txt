"THE SUN" CALLS FOR MORE FREEDOMS FOR PTO. RICO
M MAKES A CLARIFICATION TO ITS FIRST EDITORIAL CONCERNING THE ISLAND' - M Argues that it would be preferable to reduce American intervention within our Administration.
The Sun newspaper, in its February 25 editorial, makes a clarification to its first editorial on Puerto Rico, which it alleges has been misinterpreted. According to its own words, the Sun should refer to the following paragraph of its first editorial:- Since we acquired Puerto Rico we have assumed the duty of vigilance or guardianship over that island. It is for us to say to what extent that guardianship should deny the people of the island the management of their own government. We can, according to our criteria, manage that barometer, expanding it or reducing it. We consider that a reduction of it would be preferable, all the sooner posi(Continued on p. 6, 3rd col.) ro I am sure you have found in our system many good things." "Our school system, like any other system, has excellent things and even bad things. We try to improve everything, because it is susceptible to improvement. In this year we have tried to render the same services we rendered last year with a larger budget, and we have succeeded in part." "The other criticisms that are made, they don't need to be commented on."
THE 'BALTIMORE SUN' DOES NOT REFLECT THE SENTIMENT OF THE PEOPLE FOR
TORR4QUEÑO M That's the view Huyke holds as far as his Dept. is concerned. M He admits that our school system is susceptible to improvement. M Don Juan B. Huyke maintains that the statements made by the "Baltimore Sun" regarding the Puerto Rico Department of Instruction do not reflect the opinion that the Puerto Rican people have formed about it. The criticisms of the American newspaper," says the Commissioner, "with regard to public instruction, are few indeed. It makes, however, the assertion that as the figures of the budget for public instruction have increased in recent years, it can be noted that the work of the department in my charge, does not respond to the great investment that is made." "I do not know who could have brought this impression to the journalist who visited us"-Mr. Huyke goes on to tell us. "I know that she is not the accurate opinion of the Puerto Rican people. The country has faith in its schools and the Legislature is doing everything possible to maintain them at the highest possible level, so that they will render the highest possible service. I do not yet know what will be the opinion of the Columbia commission that will visit us, but the Legislature has sold shares in the schools.
FERNANDEZ ABARCA HAS SOLD $114,000 M WORTH OF YABUCOA SHARES THAT WERE ACQUIRED BY THE BEHN BROTHERS.
We have greeted Don Isidro Fernandez Abarca, the former owner of the firm "Fundicion Abarca".

Among other things we have learned that Mr. Fernán dez has just carried out a commercial transaction.
dez has just carried out a commercial transaction of great importance. He has sold the amount of 1,200 shares of the "Central Yabucoa" to the firm "Behn Brothers" at the price of $95.00 per share.

THE FARMERS ARE CONSIDERED "SLANDEROUS".
FARMERS CONSIDER THEMSELVES "SLANDERED, INJURED AND ATTACKED".
THEY CALL THE ACCUSATION THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 'BALTIMORE SUN' CAMPAIGN 'CUMULO DE CARGOS VIC10S0S' . M ' . We will continue to stay away from this diminished personalism, pointing out errors and providing evidence,' they say in an official statement.
In connection with the "Baltimore Sun" campaign and the latest editorials in "The Democracy," in which farmers believe they are alluded to as sponsors of the Continental newspaper's propaganda, the "Farmers' Association" authorizes the publication of the following statement:- TO OUR ASSOCIATES. "We are attacked, injured, and slandered. "The "Farmers' Association" is annoying; if it were possible, it would be suppressed. "We would be highly honored, if we were invited to a controversy of principles and ideals, of facts, furnishing proofs; te jos of the language of passion, far removed from that waning personalism which has generally predominated in our
that has generally predominated in our Byzantine struggles". "But to dismiss a heap of vicious charges, with no other proof than the eagerness to save the responsibility of friends; that will not do for the "Farmers' Association." "Vehgan to . our offices our associates, and we will show you the minutes, proofs and evidences of our right conduct." "Pass the inquina, which we will not fight. We will continue to point out errors and provide proof." We know that the country is with us". FARMERS' ASSOCIATION.
BARCELO TRUSTS THAT THE 'BALTIMORE SUN' WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO RECTIFY.
M The latest editorials of the Democracy/ translated into English, are sent to the North. M Pres. of the Senate campaigns in the national capital. M The editorials of "La Democracia", answering the articles of the "Baltimore Sun", are being translated into English, and copies of them sent to all the Senators and Representatives of the United States, to the "Baltimore Sun", to the "Washington Post" and to other important American newspapers. This is what we were informed yesterday by Mr. Antonio R. Barceló, President of our Senate. It is the intention of the Head of the "Alianza Portorriqueña", to distort any opinion that the congressmen and the American people in general may have formed against us. That is why he has taken the initiative of being himself the author of the Editorials in reply to the articles of the "Sun". In exchanging impressions with Mr. Barceló, he assures us that even though he is of the opinion that the good judgment and the criteria of the citizens of the United States are the best.
JUEZ ESTRELLA Df UTIMDO THE CHIEF IZQÜIÉrWÁpREHENDED, LAUNCHES THE ACCUSATION.
"TAKE YOUR $2000 AND I'LL TAKE ANOTHER $2000" HE SWEARS THAT HE PROPOSED TO M ... THE TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS APPEARED, ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN MARCANTONI, BUT MONTESERIN DENIES IT ** -- M The Chief Detective has placed the matter in the hands of Prosecutor Casalduc, after collecting allegedly overwhelming evidence.
At the Insular Police Headquarters, a statement has just been received from the Chief of Police of Utuado, Mr. Ju lio M. Izquierdo, who is accused of being the author of the theft of $10,500 property of Mr. Astol. The Chief in turn accuses the Municipal Judge of that town, Mr. Estrella, of attempted bribery. Chief Ferrer says in his statement to the police authorities: "Having had knowledge of the theft of $7,000 of Mr. Astol's property, while I was in the Catholic Church of this city, and Mr. Astol himself having indicated to me that the conscientious people of the North will not be influenced by these affirmations of the representative of the Baltimore newspaper, he has nevertheless thought it convenient to make an ample, detailed study of our situation, answering the charges against us. Thus, he believes that the Legislative Commission will not encounter so many obstacles when it goes to Washington to demand the liberalization of our Charter. Mr. Barceló claims that the "Baltimore Sun" will come to the conclusion that the situation of our island is not really so critical, and will be able to rectify its assertions.

A NEW LAWSUIT WAS FILED YESTERDAY AGAINST THE TREASURER OF THE P R.
_ _M Income Tax law challenged as illegal M Retroactivity motivates lawsuit. - m Yesterday afternoon, at three o'clock, Mr. Marrero, of the "Coll Cuchí y Cruzado Silva" Law Firm, filed a lawsuit in the Clerk's Office of the Federal Court against the Treasurer of Puerto Rico to refrain from collecting the Income Tax imposed on "Rubert Hermanos", giving retroactive effect to the last law. The lawsuit alleges that the tax is illegal because nowhere in the law is it provided that it has retroactive effect, but on the contrary, the law provides otherwise. If the lawsuit succeeds, the Treasury will be deprived of collecting a sum of about two million dollars.
