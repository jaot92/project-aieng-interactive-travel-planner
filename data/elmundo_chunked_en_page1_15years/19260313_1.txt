thirty-four thousand dollars. M THAT MONEY WILL BE THE BASIS OF AN "ORPHAN ASYLUM" M Intervention of the French Consul.-Talking with the donor. M (From our Editor in Ponce.) M Having learned that the distinguished and altruistic French gentleman, Don Francisco María Francesthi, had spontaneously donated $34,000 that he had in hypothecation on the old "Hotel Francés" building, for the establishment in his name and that of his wife, of an "Asilo de Huérfanos", and having published a letter in the local press from which he inferred that the said donation had been inspired by the French Consul. Xavier Mariani and Arcílagos, we decided to meet personally with Mr. Franceschi to know all the details of this feature that speaks a lot about the spiritual nobility of the donor. Yesterday, at ten o'clock in the morning we visited his residence and Mr. Franceschi received us kindly, surprised that the reporter had been interested in this matter of the donation, in which Mr. Franceschi, (Cont. on p. 13 third col.)
THE REASSESSMENT PLAN WILL NOT BE APPROVED AT THE EXTRAORDINARY SESSION -M. ■■ - _ _ _
THE SALES LAW WILL BE THE ONLY BUSINESS TO BE DISCUSSED FOR NOW M- Consideration of the Income-Tax is circumstantial. M- It will be impossible to include many matters in the call. --m- At the extraordinary session of the Legislature, no new plan for property reassessment will be accepted. To date, the only thing that has been considered for reconsideration is the sales law, which will be substituted by the new project that has been drafted by the committee of the Economic Conference, composed of Messrs. Barceló and Venegas. As we said in our yesterday's edition, the contribution to be levied according to the plan, ! will be made on the basis of the commercial movement of the previous year, at a rate of one percent. An attempt will be made to amend the income tax law by reducing the rate to ten per cent. But there is no assurance that this amendment will be accepted. Until the (Continued on p. 8. 3rd. col.)

LEGISLATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH CENTRALIST DICTATE": R. SOLER 'IT IS UNFAIR TO THINK THE CENTRALISTS WANT TO USE THE LEGISLATURE AS AN INSTRUMENT,' SAYS He thinks ten percent on Income-Tax is acceptable, but that eight would be preferable. M
"I am Vice-President of the "Asociación de Productores de Azúcar", and at the same time Representative to the House, and I am not capable of legislating according to what the centralists dictate if it would not benefit the country". This was the comment of Mr. José Ruiz Soler, when we read the statements made by Representative Gallardo in yesterday's edition. "We will always act in accordance with the needs of the country. We are its representatives, and above all we must watch over its welfare and happiness. I also believe
I also believe that the sugar growers only pursue a good end, beneficial to the people in general. It is up to us to study their demands, to analyze them. If they deserve our consideration, let us attend to them. It is foolish to believe that we are going to legislate to favor certain people. It is unfair to think that the sugar growers intend to use the Legislature as an instrument to protect their 'personal interests'. -What do you think of the new plan to reduce the income tax to ten percent? "I think it is reasonable. "We must open the doors to new corporations from the North. If Puerto Rico were to set a lower tax rate than the one in the United States, I am sure that many American corporations would disincorporate in the North and move to our island. In my opinion, we would be doing Puerto Rico a great favor.
THE PEOPLE OF PTO. RICO LOVES JUSTICE AND "FAIR PLAY" 2 Know the truth as it is THE CORRESPONDENCE PUBLISHED IN ITS MARCH 10 EDITION, A LETTER APPARENTLY SIGNED BY "JAMES STERLING", WHICH CONSTITUTED AN ATTACK ON THIS COMPANY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE LETTER STATED: "THERE IS THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, WITH ITS MUNICIPAL TROLLEYS, AND ITS PRESENT 3 CENT RATES, INSTEAD OF THE FIVE CENTS FORMERLY CHARGED BY THE PRIVATE COMPANIES. THE TRUTH IS, THE MILWAUKEE TROLLEYS ARE NOW OWNED BY THE MILWAUKEE ELECTRIC RAILWAY & LIGHT COMPANY, A PRIVATE COMPANY, AND THE FARE IS "SEVEN" CENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE "SEVEN CENTS", "THREE CENTS" IS CHARGED FOR EACH PASSENGER PASSING FROM THE CENTRAL OR INNER CITY AREA TO THE OUTER OR SUBURBAN AREA OF THE CITY, OR A TOTAL OF THREE CENTS FOR EACH PASSENGER PASSING FROM THE CENTRAL OR INNER CITY AREA TO THE OUTER OR SUBURBAN AREA OF THE CITY. IN ADDITION TO THE "SEVEN CENTS", A TOTAL OF "THREE CENTS" IS CHARGED TO EACH PASSENGER PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRAL AREA OF THE CITY TO THE SUBURBAN AREA, OR A TOTAL OF "TEN CENTS", INSTEAD OF THREE CENTS AS MR. STERLING HAS ALLEGEDLY SAID. THIS IS HOW THEY TRY TO DECEIVE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO. THE OTHER ASSERTIONS OF THE REFERRED "LETTER" ARE ALONG THE SAME LINES.

EDWARDS AND GALLARDO CONFERENCE. RON EXTENSIVELY WITH GOVERNOR M Giorgetti 'is plumb' with his contributions* M The Treasurer puts it plainly.
Yesterday morning we had an extensive interview with Governor Towner, the Treasurer of Puerto Rico, Juan G. Gallardo, and the Legal Counsel of the Treasury Department, Mr. Edwards. At two o'clock in the afternoon we visited the offices of Mr. Gallardo, and upon our questions the distinguished gentleman told us that the conference referred to was on official business, but he declined to make specific statements to us. We then showed him a letter we received from Ponce, where we were asked if Don Eduardo Giorgetti "was really in line with the taxes, since Gallardo in the last interview we had with him categorically answered our question", limiting himself to say that Mr. Rico if we reduced the "income tax" to eight percent. We would have new corporations in the country, and our sources of wealth would increase". When we said goodbye to Mr. Ruiz Soler, he told us that he would prefer that we not give publicity to his statements, saying that he has been ill for a long time, and that yesterday was his first outing. But as his statements are of some interest, we have decided not to indulge the "Vice President of the "Asociación de Productores de Azúcar" this time.
Giorgetti was bailing out the Treasury, and the well-known Chief of the Treasury informed us that we could assure that Don Eduardo had paid all his debts, and that he was also rendering immense help to the government, insinuating to the sugar growers that they should pay the amounts they owe to the Treasury. Gallardo told us further, that the centralists were corresponding to the demands of Don Eduardo Giorgetti, and that lately the government coffers had received a large sum of diCont. page 10, Fourth Col.
