NUMBER 3040.
ABOY BENITEZ ARGUES THAT THE COUNTRY'S HUOS WHO OWN MORE THAN 500 ACRES OF LAND WOULD GLADLY SELL IF THEY COULD FIND SOMEONE WHO WOULD PAY WELL.
M ' He alleges that this is due to excessive taxation and the fear that taxes will continue to increase. M e , A Central cannot function well if it does not have its own canes,' he says.
Mr. Ramón Aboy Benitez, who is a campaigner and impressions ftyer co To us, he stated that whenever he speaks to the press he does so in his private capacity and that in no way should his statements be attributed to him as an official representative of the "Asociación de Productores ve Azúcar" of which he is President. Even though he told us that everything we published in yesterday's edition was expressed by our editor in a private conversation without his believing that they would be made public from our columns, he nevertheless affirms that everything that was published reflects exactly what he stated, alleging that he only wishes to make a clarification, in order to avoid erroneous interpretations, and to avoid misinterpretations.In Puerto Rico there are not a dozen men to be found who can buy and cultivate 500 acres of land of the value that the land in the central cities is now worth. Mr. Aboy Benitez expressed himself in the following terms."What I wanted to tell him was that there was no twelve acres of land, at such high prices at which the land is dedicated to the cultivation of sugar cane, because of course, there are quite a few Boricuas, unfortunately not many, and far from the number that would be needed if they would force the centrale**" to give up the excess of 500 acres or let's say 5.00Ó, which, because of their financial situation, could do so, if they saw a business in it. Since I am making this clarification, I am going to extend myself to say that the same Puerto Ricans who today have 500 cuerdas of land and cultivate them, with very rare exceptions, would sell them if they were well paid, because they cannot support the high taxes (Continued on page 16, Ira. col.).
Puerto Rican journalists played a very special role in the Pan-American Press Congress. M BECAME THE LINK OF UNION! BETWEEN LATINOS AND SAJONES M Our representative sends us his impressions. -For the first time in the history of journalism in the American continent, a congress has been convened composed of journalists coming from the 21 countries of the Hispanic America. Puerto Rico has been invited and its newspapers are represented by distinguished members of its EL MUNDO and "Puerto Rico Ilustrado" have a representative, and he has been pleased to observe among his colleagues from other countries of America that these companies are known, respected and admired for their rapid and safe development. ANIMOS OF THE CONGRESS The Congress should not be taken too seriously. In such a complex Assembly, and within such a short space of time, it is not possible to make transcendental work of ideas. The importance of the Congress is that the journalists have an opportunity to be together, to talk, to exchange impressions and ideas for a month. When they return to their countries, all the journalists have a chance to meet, to talk, to exchange impressions and ideas for a month.

"IF I AM APPOINTED, I WILL DO MY UTMOST TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE MARKET.
"In accepting the distinction made to me by the Socialist Party, naming me their candidate for the office of Charity Commissioner of San Juan, I am moved by a great personal interest that tries to prevent this party to which I belong from being orphaned of a candidate for said office, after what happened to the previous candidate, Dr. Bocanegra, when he was rejected by Mayor Todd". When we visited the offices of Dr. Narciso Moreno, the new socialist candidate for the position of Charity Commissioner of San Juan, so that he could give us his impressions about the distinction accepted by him, these were the first words he let us know. Then he continued: "Already nominated for the candidacy for this position, my acceptance means that if I am appointed I will do everything in my power to march in complete harmony with the demands of the Department that I have to attend to, and for
Speech by Mr. Cordova Davila in the United States House of Representatives on April 7, 1926. I am presented today with the most brilliant opportunity to make my voice heard in this Congress, with the authority given me by the circumstance of being the only member representing here a country of Latin origin, on an occasion when under the vaults of this Capitol the heralds of the culture and civilization of the Spanish-speaking peoples of the American continent are being remembered. The celebration of the First Pan American Congress of Journalists, which will be held in the Capitol, is a great opportunity for us.

"PUERTO RICO HAS NEVER DENIED ITS ORIGINS AND LOVES AND VENERATES ITS TRADITIONS," SAID DR. CORDOVA DAVILA IN HIS SPEECH TO THE CONGRESO PERIODISTICO. M Yero in the current in which destiny has placed it, it unfolds victoriously making American life', he added. M
The course is of extraordinary transcendence and its beneficial effects will benefit Latin America and Saxon America alike. It will serve to awaken a mutual confidence between the two peoples; a more intimate rapport of ideals and purposes between the two races of this Hemisphere and will open the way to a perfect identification of one and the other in the common ideal of aggrandizing America by making its ideals of liberty and democracy ever firmer and its institutions of humanity and justice ever more consistent.

HIS HOMBERS THE DE PART AMENT OF AUDIT M He clarifies his position within the past Unionist Administration. "I am always ready to give an account of my official acts," he says. M Engineer Don Rafael Nones has addressed the following letter to Auditor Holcomb: San Juan, P. RAbril 15, 1926. Hon. Auditor of Puerto Rico. San Juan, P. R. Sir: I have read in "El Imparcial" of the 14th of the current month, the report rendered by an examiner of the accounts of said Department, with respect to the investigation made in the books and accounts of the Municipality of San Juan, in the period between October 14, 1923 and January 12, 1925. As I resigned in the Municipality the position of Engineer of the Works of the Empréstito on May 7, 1923, upon the departure of Ledo. Martin Travieso, that is to say, 5 months before the period covered by the investigation made by the employee of that Department, I was surprised to "see my name appearing as having any responsibility in the works and expenditures made during that period of time. The fact that I ordered trt luiJlwatMttUTfe! CamiñcTque" , T> clera this one and a quarter meters wider, does not justify that your employee cites me as responsible for the fact that the works were exceeded by more than! twenty percent. because when I gave the aforementioned order it was by mandate of my immediate boss, the Director of Municipal Public Works, and the order was given to take effect only to cover an excess of work no greater than twenty percent of the total of the contract, as is shown in the only document signed by me on this matter that your employee may have seen, which document is the following letter answering one from my successor in the position, engineer Mr. Manuel Font. * i San Juan, P. R. Sept 7, 1923. Mr. Manuel Font, Engineer of the Works of the Empréstito, Municipality of San Juan. Sir: I have the pleasure to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 6 and of the copy of the letter sent to the Commissioner of Public Works by the contractor Mr. Enrique Amadeo, regarding the increase of work in the contract for the construction of the road for the new San Juan aqueduct. As you may recall, when you handed over to him the position of Engineer of the Works of the Empréstito, among other things you manifested to him (Continued on p. 16, 8th Col.)

M The Chief Executive is sending a special representative to the Philippines. M The success or failure of these plans depends on his report. M- The important American newspaper "New York Times", famous for the seriousness it prints in its information, contains a piece of news that should interest us Puerto Ricans to the highest degree, since it affects us so closely, as the reader will see later on. The "New York Times" reports that President Coolidge is seriously considering the project of appointing a Governor General for all the island possessions, including Puerto Rico. In a word, Tjlipinas, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Samoa, i and other islands belonging to the American Goj biemo, would be governed by up central official. The President has begun to develop his plans by sending to the Philippines, Hawaii, Samoa, and Guam an expert, a commissioner especiali*4klr. Thompson, who will make a study of the situation there, and will make a comprehensive report on his return to Washington. It only remains for a study of the situation in Puerto Rico to be made before the President decides whether to continue to push forward with the project in question or to discard it altogether. In any case, the report of Thompson, who will be accompanied by several experts, will greatly influence the President's decision. Thompson's trip to the Pacific possessions is therefore of more importance than we have given him credit for. ' Mr. Reilly obtained this Information by a wireless message received at the offices of the Department during the early hours of yesterday morning.
