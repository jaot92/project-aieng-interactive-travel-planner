H A cablegram received in núes Ora editorial office reports that no le-pro-Puerto Rico will be■ considered during the presents congrcsional session. W This means that not even the Governor-elect bill will be discussed in the American Parliament. Senator Martinez Davila, the well-known majority leader, whom we have questioned in this respect, has made the following statements:- í "I have not had time to read the pablegram to which you refer. Besides, it is very difficult to give a concrete opinion when, as in this case, there are no details. I would like it to be that the. Congress of short session has not been able to give attention to the legislation in Puerto Rico, and that there is the matter to be discussed at the next session; but at any rate, we would need to know if and how any action has been taken with respect to the postponement.

Disparities of opinion on the policy of 'EL MUNDO' prompted the resignation of the Director. M
A NECESSARY EXPLANATION M Since our dear friend the distinguished writer Don Luis Rechani Agrait resigned, a few days ago, from his duties as editor of EL MUNDO, so many wrong comments have been made about his resignation, that, in order to completely disprove them and put the truth in its proper place, we are obliged to give an explanation. As far as we are concerned, we do not care what the gratuitous enemies of the newspaper say, but since, on the other hand, Mr. Rechani's name is involved, we want to publicly declare that the resignation of our esteemed colleague, who until recently shared with us the journalistic task, was due to differences of opinion about the policy that EL MUNDO should follow. About three months ago, for reasons of political and social interest, we decided to resign from the editorial board of EL MUNDO. Col.

"I AM COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO THE AUCTION OF THE AQUEDUCT BY SECTIONS": P. J. BARBOSA
I FAVOR DIFFERENT AUCTIONS, THE WORKS WOULD BE FINISHED IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME': CABRERA
Assemblymen Diago and Martínez Roselló do not want to issue their criteria yet - Opinion is very divided.
The final plans for the San Juan aqueduct have already been approved by the Interior Commissioner. It is now up to Mr. Montilla to prepare the bidding specifications and the budget for the work and submit them to the Municipal Assembly for consideration. Should a single auction be held for all the aqueduct works, or is it preferable to hold several separate auctions? There are conflicting criteria in the Municipal Assembly, which will give rise to heated debates whenever this matter is brought up for discussion. A bill, granting the elective Governor to Puerto Rico, has been introduced in Congress. M It is authored by Representative Bloom. M Near the end" of the congressional session, a Democrat introduces a bill in the U.S. Congress, granting us the elective Governor. Here is the cablegram we received yesterday afternoon:- WASHINGTON, May 14, (United Press, Via All America Cables Dispatch e=pecial to THE WORLD). -Representative Bloom, Democrat of New York, has introduced in the House a bill Continued on p. 10, 3rd Col.
Here's how several of the Assemblymen think:- SAYS PEDRO JUAN BARBOSA: "I am com presely opposed to the sectional auction. I think it would be convenient to have a general auction. Past experience shows us that the partial contractor does not offer the same security as the general contractor of the works. The contractor of partial works can, at a given moment, and if he deems it convenient for him, terminate the contract with great detriment to the municipality. If the general auction were held, the bond would of course be considerably high, and no contractor would terminate the contract, fearful of losing an excessive amount. "As far as time is concerned, I believe that the quickest way to build the works is precisely by holding a general auction". CABRERA'S ASSEMBLYMAN SPEAKS: "I am in favor of having different auctions and not to include the whole project in a single one". "There are several reasons that compel me to support this criterion, but the fundamental, the essential one, is that the works would be completed in a shorter period of time. And I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Municipal Assembly share this same criterion that I am presenting to you". DON GONZALO DIAGO DOES NOT WANT TO OPINION: Assemblyman Gonzalo Diago, whom we also questioned on this same matter, told us that it was somewhat risky to give an opinion now, since it was still too early to make a decision.

THE FRUIT GROWERS PROTEST AGAINST THE CUSTOMS AND THE PROHIBITION OF THE REGISTRATION OF THE SHIPS.
.. M A LLEGATE THAT THIS DELAY IS CAUSING THEM GREAT MATERIAL LOSSES --M Scoville has the leading voice in this matter.A petition to Collector Moore. You The Customs and Prohibic on aitorldades have lately been inspecting all ships leaving our ports bound for the North. The inspection, of course, goes on for several hours, which has been the cause of serious* complaints on the part of the island's fruit growers. "The Fruit Growers' Association of Puerto Rico has addressed the Collector of Customs, Mr. Moore, and the Chief of Prohibition, alleging that this search by his subordinates on ships carrying fruit to the United States often lasts three and four hours, causing a delay in transportation, a delay which represents a great loss to the fruit growers. They have vigorously protested against this measure adopted during the last few weeks, maintaining that on several occasions they have had to suffer great inconvenience, and that if this attitude is not put an end to, they will have to approach the national authorities in complaint. Mr. Scoville, Vice-President of the "Asociación de Agricultores de Puerto Rico" and one of the directors of the "Asociación de Fruttros" has taken the lead in this protest, and is willing to accept strong measures to prevent a repetition of these facts, which they allege are extremely detrimental to the fruit growers of the island. They argue that the Customs and Prohibition inspectors do not need to remain searching the ships for so many hours, as they understand that this work can be extremely detrimental to the island's fruit growers. Juan finishes in fifteen months, and if we move in time the "Captain Houston" will leave for this port as soon as she carries out the dredging of the capital port. "If after the effort made by the Legislature, the Governor, our Commissioner in Washington, and the federal government in favor of such a great work, we turn our backs on this opportunity, it will be our responsibility for the failure. It is up to the Municipal Assembly to resolve.
THE REPORT. SOTOMAYOR CLARIFIES HIS POSITION REGARDING THE PONCE PORT DREDGING M
Sotomayor claims that his presence at the public hearing was merely casual. M-"It's up to the Municipal Assembly to resolve," he says. M The representative to the House, Mr. Luis Sotomayor, wishes to clarify that his presence at the public hearing held in Ponce to discuss the convenience of dredging that port was merely by chance. Entering into explanations, Mr. Sotomayor says that he was neither invited, nor was he aware that such an act was being held. He states, however, that he was surprised to learn of it, since he, as representative for that district, and as one of the advocates of the project in the Legislature, should have been invited to the meeting with the engineers of the War Department. Lu<$n., entering fully into the matter, says: "The dredging of the Ponee harbor is not a project or an aspiration of the present. This idea was always in the minds of the men who formed that generation that gave rise to Ponce being called "the brain of the island". "The purto dagado, with its respective seawall, will provide great advantages, not only to commerce but also to navigation. The plans are ready. All we have to do is to build a seawall before the federal government allocates funds for dredging. We must not forget that we have until the third of June to reply to Washington, stating our final resolution, either one way or the other. "The dredge work in San the municipal engineer, Senor Montilla, had not had time to rerdir the detailed budget and specifications*. DR. MARTINEZ ROSELLO: "I will wait for the matter to be submitted to the Municipal Assembly. I have not yet formed any judgment. Everything depends on the circumstances. In the course of a discussion, your opinion may change, that is why I do not want to make a judgment in this or that sense".
HUYKE MAINTAINS THAT GIORGETTI'S OPINION, IN RELATION TO INSTRUCTION IN PUERTO RICO, IS UNFOUNDED.
I WILL NOT OPPOSE AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PUERTO RICAN SCHOOL,' HE SAYS.
I believe, however, that in educational matters we are still not doing enough'.
Yesterday we visited the Commissioner of Instruction, Don Juan B. Huyke in order to solicit his impressions on the memorial submitted by the agricultural, sugar and commercial delegations to the Secretary of War, especially on that part which refers to public instruction in Puerto Rico. The distinguished educator made the following statements: EMBARKS HUYKE ON THE 20th OF THIS MONTH M Will attend the convention of the 'General Association of Teachers'. M Deputy Commissioner Vizcarrondo will also be present. M The Commissioner of Instruction, Don Juan B. Huyke, will embark for the United States on Thursday, the 20th of this month, unless something extraordinary arises to prevent it. Various purposes bring Mr. Huyke to the North. In the first place he proposes to visit as many industrial schools as possible, where he will observe the existing system, in order to implant the best methods in Puerto Rico. Our Commissioner of Instruction is very much interested in this project, and he is very much interested in the system of industrial schools.
"I have read the statements of! Mr. Giorgetti in relation to the expenditures for public instruction. The noted financier says that these expenditures are not justified by the benefits derived from it." "Touch me to respect that opinion, although it seems to me that it is unfounded. Neither the 'Farmers' Association, nor the Chamber of Commerce, nor the 'Sugar Producers' Association' have, so far as I know, made any study relating to the results that may be derived from educational work." "We are raising a country, making a country, and creating an intelligent youth, ready to open up a field in or out of it. What the school has done to date is great, and the people challenge it so. It has not' measured this effort, however." "Now," Mr. Huyke continues, "I will not oppose an investigation of the Puerto Rican school in connection with the work it does; on the contrary, I welcome it. For this most important work, which is far from perfect, all lights are necessary, and if an investigation of our work gives the "Farmers' Association", the "Sugar Producers' Association" and the Chamber of Commerce the reason, I will be the first to respect the opinion. I believe, however, that we are still not doing enough in the matter of public instruction, and that if the question is studied impartially, this will be the conclusion that will be reached". So much for the statements of the Commissioner of Instruction.
