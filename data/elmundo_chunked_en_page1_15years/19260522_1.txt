BARCELO ADDRESSED FROM WASHINGTON TO GIORGETTI
M The President of the Senate believes that before adopting any attitude, they should hold an exchange of impressions M Even though our politicians, economists and businessmen are maintaining the most absolute reserve and discretion at this time, the movement initiated to harmonize relations between the representatives of the country's vital forces and the legislative delegates who appeared before the national authorities in Washington to explain the situation of Puerto Rico is still in progress. It is not only a question of the steps taken by Don Luis Sanchez Morales, in his efforts to reach a good understanding, although this gentleman is constantly working, holding daily conferences with Don Eduardo Giorgetti, even though, according to what he told us yesterday, he was not following certain plans. Eduardo Giorgetti has received a communication from Don Antonio R. Barceló. The President of the Senate and leader of the "Alianza Portorriqueña" recommends the notable financier to refrain from making any comments or adopting any attitude, until he has the opportunity to exchange impressions with him upon his return to the island. ~~ As we said before, the strictest reserve is observed, even though the expectation in our political and industrial circles is extraordinary. Although it has not been possible for us to know the letter of Mr. Barcelo verbatim, we nevertheless know that it has no other purpose than to settle the differences which have arisen on the occasion of the memorial. - EXCHANGES M * Dollar, (New York) . . 20c.

JUDGE BERGA RESOLVES A CASE RELATED TO THE LAST ELECTIONS.
M Acquitted a defendant of perjury. M : José Inés Carrión, who acted as challenger in Santurce for the Historical Constitutional Party during the last elections, was accused of perjury, for having challenged the voter Ambrosio Torres, alleging that he was not the same person who appeared on the electoral lists. -Several months ago, the case was heard before the Petit Jury, which declared him guilty after a brief deliberation. The Honorable Judge Foote sentenced him to serve one year's imprisonment. But the defense, Ledo. Martinez Nada 1 , the defense counsel asked the gentlemen of the petit jury whether or not they had belonged to the grand jury which had indorsed the indictment of perjury against the accused as founded, and all having answered in the negative, it later turned out that two of the gentlemen of the petit jury had been members of the grand jury. The Ledo. Saturnino Martinez, for murder, reported in volume 30 of the "Puerto Rico Decisions,'' the case of the People v. Saturnino Martinez, for murder, was decided in this case by the Supreme Court, by virtue of the actions of Ledo. Martinez Nadal, who brought this case to the Supreme Court from the Ponce District Court, the Honorable Judge Sepulveda granted the motion for a new trial and ordered a new hearing. In this state of the matter, Ledo. Martinez Nadal preferred to avail himself of the jurisprudence of the court of law, alleging that "a judge aware of his duties is in a better position to judge a case of this nature, than a Jury." Lately this case was heard before the honorab'e Judge Berga. This magistrate, after carefully examining the "" accusation and evidence, gave his opinion on the matter, and acquitted the accused José Inés Carrión.

M Mr. Córdova Dávila's new bill, aimed at limiting the powers of the Federal Court in granting injunctions challenging the tax laws of our Legislature, has given rise to many comments and diverse interpretations by the island's most distinguished politicians and lawyers. The Hon. Judge Wells, however, insists on remaining silent and refuses to make any statements of any kind about the much talked about bill. When interviewed by us, he stated that he did not know in depth the project of our Resident Commissioner, and (Continued in 6, 2nd Col.)

At the next meeting to be held by the Economic Conference, the various Commissions appointed to study the budget, the tax system and, in general, the economic situation of the country will render their respective reports.

Several mayors of the island have joined the movement initiated a few days ago by the head of the Ponce municipal administration, Mr. Vivas Valdivieso. Our readers will recall that Mr. Vivas Valdivieso sent a telegram to all his colleagues, in which he stated his protest against the memorial filed with the Secretary of War, and invited them to extend that protest in the name of the island municipalities to the federal authorities in Washington. And we said that several mayors have already replied to Mr. Vivas. Among those who support the project, several mayors have already replied to Mr. Vivas.

our editor in Ponce) } -We would like to know your opinion on the current political situation. ...." -I would rather not speak. Thus my word would not be out of tune with the general chorus of servility that still surrounds us, although, fortunately, other dissonant voices are already being heard because of their sincerity and courage. But, since you are speaking, what do you think of the activities of the Legislative Commission of Puerto Rico in Washington? Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the final report of this body will have the full attention of the Governor, should he decide to call the Legislature into special session.
In general terms, I am of the opinion that the Legislative Commission suffered a singular failure in Washington. Its only pro- - blcmatic triumph, was that it was eliminated. Ptu'vto Ri<-o <t, the rigors of the Kiess Amendment; but this triumph is only apparent, if it is taken into account that, according to the Speaker of the House, it was never in the mind of the National Administration to include Puerto Rico in the text of the amendment. The triumph of the Commission, therefore, has been reduced to calling the attention of a Congressional Committee to an error in the text of the Eioss Bill. For the rest, the material failure was complete, and the moral failure..., absolute! -Absolute, did you say? Continued on p. 6a. p. 6a. Col.

A PUERTO RICAN HAS BEEN NAMED SEC. GENERAL OF THE GREAT SEVILLE EXPOSITION *.
MY GREATEST JOY WOULD BE FOR PUERTO RICO TO HAVE A PAVILION IN WHICH ITS PRODUCTS WOULD BE EXHIBITED EXCLUSIVELY'.
This is how the young engineer, Sánchez Apellániz, to whom such a high honor has been granted, expresses himself.
Yesterday we went to visit Mr. Luis Sanchez Morales, to ask his opinion on some current issues and he answered us smiling that he already seemed to have spoken enough in these days with reference to political issues. "But," he said, "I am going to give you some news that I think is interesting. Readers of EL MUNDO will be pleased to learn that a Puerto Rican has been appointed to the post of Secretary General of the Seville Exposition. "He is a young engineer, Mr. Francisco Sánchez Apellániz y Fer nández, son of the well-known retired Colonel Don Francisco Sánchez Apeliániz, highly esteemed in this island where he enjoyed general sim patfas. THE AGRICULTURAL CONGRESS PROMISES TO BE A GREAT EVENT M- Intense propaganda is carried out to get the greatest number of farmers and stockbreeders to attend. M, The idea of holding an exhibition of Creole products at the same time fails; M Next July a transcendental event of an agricultural nature will take place in the city of Mayagüez. We are referring to the Agricultural Congress, which under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture and Labor, will be held on that date in the "Sultana del Oeste" (Sultan of the West). The Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture, Mr. Bagué, intends to make this Congress an event of scientific dissemination. The most difficult aspects related to the sowing, cultivation and harvesting of the different tropical fruits, such as eañá, tobacco, coffee and algae, will be discussed.
The young Sánchez Apellániz did his engineering studies in Belgium and has been living in Seville for some time. The prestige and esteem that he has been able to win, have led him to the general secretariat of the Exhibition, a position of great responsibility and work, on which depends to a great extent the success of the monumental enterprise that Spain has in project". Mr. Sánchez Morales is a relative of the young Sánchez Apellá niz, with whom he corresponds. From the last letter received by Don Luis we copy the following paragraphs: "If San Juan de Puerto Rico were not so far away, I would have come to see you to exchange impressions with you and, above all, to listen to your advice and learn something of the great experience you have of public life, but unfortunately it is so far away that communication has been reduced, we could say, to a telecommunication of desire and thought. "I would be very grateful if you would be so kind as to tell me "in what state are the official arrangements for Puerto Rica's participation in this Exposition, and above all, the state of mind there is in that country with respect to the event. "My greatest joy would be for Puerta Rico to have a pavilion in which its products would be exhibited exclusively, but if its exhibition is to be held in the "United States Building", we must work for it to have a preferential place, where Puerto Rican products would be exhibited exclusively. Now, with more reason than before, it is necessary that you come to this exhibition. The embrace we will give each other would be truly symbolic: we are both Hispanic Americans; we are Puerto Ricans; the vagaries of history have made you an American Puerto Rican and me a Puerto Rican-Spanish. We are the same race and the same blood, and I embrace you upon your arrival to this, this would be the symbol of the union of all the Hispanic race that so great tafito in this peninsula as in all those territories of America". We are unimagined of Mr. Sanchez. Morales satisfied "! pride you are to the news that in the old Medre Patria", one "Jenuestros compatriots". one "Jenuestros compatriots Had'VÜ1Ó obieto of so high honor. -
