"THE MEMORIAL F U E ERROR OF APPRECIATION OF THE MOMENT, THE IMPOSITION OF THE SITUATION IN WHICH YOU FOUND YOURSELVES." M
■ IW ■ | AS I WAS IN RESPONSE TO DON LUIS SANCHEZ MORALES' LETTER FROM GIORGETTI L . / -- M -; - 'You have meant what you have said, without doing harm to the country.'-'The great error of the memorial is its inopportunity of time and place,' he adds. " M
" -" Don Luis Sanchez Morales 'di. governs the following letter to Don Eduardo Giorgetti, in reply to the one we published yesterday from this gentleman: t Mr. Don Eduardo Giorgetti. San Juan, P. R. r My distinguished friend:I have read in EL MUNDO the letter which you are pleased to address to me, and to which I have the pleasure of replying. - The economic problems being discussed in the country have created two opposing camps of opinion, whose positions, as always happens in these cases, are extreme. The violence of the discussion and the consequent passion, create situations and compromises that sometimes drag men ' j born and patriotic, to actions that have unjust and harmful consequences for their country. And often, as in this case, men who proceed in this way, although good and intelligent, firmly convinced that they are right, do not stop to think that there are very reasonable things, perfectly improper and inopportune. -. You invite me to point out errors in the Memorial. The great error of the Brief, well and coldly written, and which points out defects that we all want to correct, is its inopportunity of time and place. At the very moment when Puerto Rico presents itself in Washington to demonstrate that it is ready for a greater government of its own, representations of important organizations of the country make a colossal army of suits and suits and a colossal army of people in the streets of Washington. A colossal army of suits and shirts for gentlemen will battle with a formidable army of effects for ladies and children. Get ready to attend such an extraordinary spectacle!

IGLESIAS TO REMAIN IN THE COUNTRY FOR TWO MORE MONTHS ' M-- ' Receives a letter from General McIntyre. M-_ Hopes that upon his return to the Island for, the regular legislative session, the political situation will have been defined. M " ■ Senator Santiago Iglesias has stated to us, that unless a problem of an ' international character arises which obliges him to aban ( donate immediately our island, ¡to attend to his duties as Secretary of the "Confederación ■ Obrera Pan Americana", he proposes to remain in Puerto Rico two months longer. He will perform the duties of his post, until the ¡"Pan American Labor Congress" elects the person to serve . said office, and if he continues in the Secretariat, he is determined to return to our island, to take part in the ordinary legislative session to be held next year. | I will return," says the President of the Socialist Party, "when perhaps the current political situation has become clearer and it is known what direction all these groups in a state of apparent rebellion are going to take". Mr. Iglesias shows us a copy of a letter addressed to him by General McIntyre, informing him of having received the document addressed by numerous Puerto Rican workers about the economic situation. This document was supported by thirteen thousand signatures, and our readers are familiar with it, as we have reported on it extensively in our columns. The letter from the Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs also acknowledges receipt of other documents submitted by the SenapVENDOfl Magnificent farm of my property, ten minutes from San Juan, with plenty of cattle, abundant water, beautiful modern stable and milk production sold to do- . nücilio.

IN THESE TERMS LANDRON ADDRESSES DON ANTONIO R. BARCELO M 'You are obliged to prove that when you launch an accusation against a man, it is documented', says ' M Don Enrique Landrón sent us yesterday for publication, the following note replying to Mr. Barceló: "I have read the manifestations of Mr. Barceló in today's EL MUNDO. Don't go off on a tangent, Mr. Barceló. Do not come now with that he has not accused me of administrative immoralities. Whoever is "unable to point out norms of good administration to the municipalities" is because he has been guilty, or of immorality, or of incompetence". "I challenge Mr. Barceló to prove with official data one or the other. It is easy to obtain certifications, balance sheets, liquidations of works, budgets, cash operations, certifications of investigations by the Audit Department, etc. I have already exempted from judicial responsibility anyone who publishes the complete "/record" of my administrative management in Arecibo, no matter how much it may harm me mentally or materially. To demand such I liability is a right which Iglesias, for the consideration of the national authorities. i The letter reads as follows:- Dear Mr. Iglesias: i Your letter of March 29, after having been carefully ' studied and considered by President Coolidge and the Secretary of War, has been referred to this - Bureau, where such documents I are filed, in order to be used ' when the matter is brought up for discussion." Sincerely, FRANK MCINTYRE.

M 1 We visited Don Eduardo Gior- , gattl, at his private offices yesterday, and to our questions he informed us as follows: "I only wish to state one thing. I want to say to Puerto Rico clearly and categorically, first, that the economic question, that is to say, the Memorial of the living forces, has nothing to do with the political problem. Second, that the "Farmers' Association" as well as the Chamber of Commerce and the "Sugar Producers' Association" have no political connection with the case which I proposed to bring before the Board of Directors of the "Puerto Rican Alliance" when a commission of that organization came to meet with me. And thirdly, that as a Unionist and a Puerto Rican I will prove to my party and to the honest and sensible people of Puerto Rico that my actions in Washington have been the same as those I have always carried out for my country. !
