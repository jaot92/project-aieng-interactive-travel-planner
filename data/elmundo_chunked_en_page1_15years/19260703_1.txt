THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO PUT INTO EFFECT THE OLD BUDGET.
M This was reported to us yesterday by Treasurer Gallardo. M Mediating the circumstance that the Governor lia recommended to the Legislature to amend the budget which is to govern during the current fiscal year, reducing it to nine million dó-! Jares, and since the Legislature has not yet taken definite action in this matter, we visited Treasurer Gallardo yesterday, to ask him if the same budget of last year, which was approved to govern for two years, had been put into effect, or if, on the contrary, he had received any special order from Governor Towner to attend to those more urgent needs with special funds, destined for that purpose, until the budget approved last year was amended. Mr. Gallardo told us that he had received no instructions from the Chief Executive as yet, and that he considered that there would be no need to adopt any special measures, since the new budget would probably be drafted and approved within five or six days, and that the people of Puerto Rico would not have to wait for the budget to be approved. On July 24, 1926, at 9:00 A. M., the auction will be held in the City Hall Building of the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico. M. will take place in the City Hall Building, in the Mayor's Office, in a public act, the Auction for the construction of deep wells to inject three million (3,000,000) gallons of subway water per day of twenty-four (24) hours into the main pipeline of the aqueduct. The bid model, instructions to bidders, bidding documents and other background information related to the works are available at the Office of the Director of Public Works, Municipalities, and copies of the documents may be obtained by means of a receipt that certifies that each interested party has deposited in the Office of the Municipal Treasurer of San Juan, the amount of $10.00, which will be reimbursed if all the documents are returned complete and in good condition within twenty days after the auction has been held. The Auction Board may reject any or all bids submitted and reserves the right to award the contract to the bid it deems most advantageous, even if it is not the lowest in price. R. H. TODD, Mayor of San Juan (Announcement).
THE "MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF PUERTO RICO" IS SUMMONED TO AN EXTRAORDINARY MEETING.
-M The President of the "Medical Association of Puerto Rico", Dr. Eer nández García, has summoned by telegraph all associates to an extraordinary meeting of said organization, which will take place tonight, at eight o'clock, at the Association's meeting rooms, located at Tanca 10-1 [2. The problem of public welfare and the latest developments, will be the subject of extensive discussion. The meeting is of great importance due to special circumstances. Our readers are not unaware that several towns have become orphans of the charitable service, due to the refusal of the Municipal Assembly to increase the material remuneration of the incumbent doctors. - The Committee has been informed that during the last few days there have been major problems, which, if any, could easily be dealt with, since there was always a contingency fund for this purpose, which could be used in cases of this nature until such time as definitive action was taken on the new budget. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC HEARING --M The Committee on Public Works and Public Lands will hold a public hearing next Tuesday, the 6th of the present, at two o'clock in the House building, for the purpose of hearing opinions for or against House Joint Resolution No. 13 "To amend Joint Resolution No. 43, approved July 31, 1925, entitled "Joint Resolution providing that the Commissioner of the Interior shall proceed to construct a connecting road between Central No. 1 and No. 3, starting from Central No. 1 and No. 3. 1 and No. 3, starting from near the Martín Peña Bridge, South part, and ending at kilometer 0 hectometer 9 of Highway No. 3 that goes from Río Piedras to Carolina, authorizing the Commissioner of the Interior himself to admit the cooperation and donations of the municipality of Río Piedras, corporations and other persons interested in the construction of said road and for other purposes".

D. Eduardo Giorgetti comments on the Governor's Message and the extraordinary session of the Legislature.
things will remain as they are, says M- Answering our questions, Mr. Eduardo Giorgetti has made the following statements: -What do you think, Mr. Giorgetti. of the Governor's message? -It is a very skillful document, expressly designed to place on the Legislature of Puerto Rico all the responsibility for the economic consequences that an unwise and farsighted legislation will bring to the country. The Governor makes recommendations to the Legislature knowing, in advance, that such recommendations will not be heeded. Things will remain as they were. -What do you tell us with respect to the University Act? -With respect to the University Act, I believe that the amendment will be passed in order to make that additional contribution permanent and not for one year only, as the law is now. This contribution from the University will increase to eight hundred thousand dollars, since the valuation of the island will reach four hundred million dollars, according to the bill. It is clear that this is the Government's plan, judging by the appraisal they are doing in different towns, increasing up to double the current appraisal" of the farms. I -And what do you think about the hydroelectric contribution? I -That they will amend the law in order to make it effective, which is not effective today because the island of Vieques has been exempted from this contribution. -And what do you tell us about the budget? -That it will remain almost the same as it is: if anything, they will make an insignificant reduction that is not worthwhile. -And what about the sales law? -That if they amend it, they will do so.

M Thus io reported yesterday by cable to Sub-Comisio-nado Bagué. M- He is coming aboard the Spanish steamer "Leon XIII." M This afternoon the Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor, Mr. Carlos E. Chardon, will arrive in Puerto Rico. His negotiations in the Republic of Colombia, where he went with the purpose of installing a 'School of Agriculture and Culture' and an 'Expcrinieu tal Station', took him more time than he had calculated, and therefore, he had to delay the date of his return to the island. A few days ago a cablegram message was received at the Department of Agriculture from Mr. Chas dón. communicating that he would embark for Puerto Rico on board the Spanish steamer Leon XIII. Since then there had been no further news of the Commissioner's trip, until yesterday morning, when Dr. Jaime Bagué, Deputy Commissioner of the Department, received the following aerogram dated on board the Leon XIII: "Wait for me on eleven Saturday afternoons". We extend to Mr. Chardon our cordial greetings of welcome. putting one per cent. on all articles, which is the same as doubling the present contribution. -Do you not think that the Governor having argued so well, in regard to the repeal of the four cents per quintal of (Continued on 6, 6th Col.)

GOVERNOR DECLINES TO COMMENT ON ATTITUDE TAKEN BY CERTAIN LEGISLATORS
The minority will fight to ensure the resolution's success by authorizing a $70 million loan. M AS WE WERE INFORMED YESTERDAY BY REPRESENTATIVE ALONSO M Explains what such a large sum is for. M In the corridors of the House yesterday we greeted Socialist Representative Alonso, whom we questioned about the scope of the Joint Resolution he has filed in order to obtain a $70,000,000 loan from the National Government. "The Resolution itself," Mr. Alonso told us, "is a memo ral to Congress and the national authorities presenting the economic problem of Puerto Rico, in accordance with a plan whose development requires the sum of $70,000,000. "The idea is not new, for Congress has already aided in the economic development of many states of the Union, and of territories such as Alaska, to which it has donated $140,000,000,000- For this loan to succeed, it will be necessary for the Legislature to outline the program of what it proposes to do with the money. When we say program, we refer to the following points: "1-How much the people of Puerto Rico need to finish their school buildings. 2-. The conversion of the educational system from an academic to a practical one. 3.-Subsidies that could be given by the State to convert our production in equal parts into Agricultural and Industrial. 4. -Destruction of the feudal system of the landowners, which is so important for the country's economy.
M WISHES BEFORE DOING SO THAT THE CHAMBERS EXPRESS THEIR OFFICIAL CRITERION M However, he has a special interest in knowing the fate of his recommendations. M Yesterday we were talking with Governor Towner, whom we questioned regarding the statements of many legislators who do not agree with certain recommendations made by the Chief Executive in his Message to the Legislature. The Governor replied that he did not wish to comment in any way on the attitude now adopted by the legislators, reserving the right to do so when they had officially expressed their criteria. The Governor is of the opinion that when senators and representatives study the matter in depth, they will be convinced of the benefits to be obtained by the mixed commissions. {I When asked if he wanted to comment on the project presented in the Senate by Messrs. Barceló and Sánchez Morales, in this respect, he told us that he did not want to discuss said plan, nor make any comment. He concluded by telling us that he was especially interested in knowing the final result of his recommendations to the Legislature.

"WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF WE UNLOAD ON AN AUDITOR THE UNWIELDY ROLE OF BUDGETING?
M He maintains that this legislative power was annulled by the Governor during the last regular session. M
In his message to the Legislature, Governor Towner recommends the appointment of the Auditor of Puerto Rico as the Director of the Budget. This indication of the Chief Executive has been the subject of many comments in our high political, administrative and legislative circles. Here is what Senator Francisco M. Zeno told us yesterday when we asked for his opinion on this matter: -* i "I cannot favor anything that implies subtracting anything from the twist of power piously granted to the popular representation by our Organic Charter." "On the other hand, I think that this same twist of power is pure fantasy. The budget law is the fundamental law which should best reflect the personali- i t y of the Insular Legislature, and our power to intervene in it was practically nullified by the precedent set by Governor Towner, tearing into fragments the budget passed at the 'last regular session. What difference does it make, then, if we unload on an Auditor, that not very graceful role of making budgets? i "So that, in reality, I have not cared much rJ little for the Chief Executive's recommendation in that respect, just as I have not lost any sleep over one letter or all that i contained in the disputed document. It is not worth it. However, the Governor must feel jubilant with the congratulations of the Steering Committee of the "Farmers' Association."
Tous Soto accepts paternity of the telegram which has given rise to the protest of the 'Aso ciation of Farmers' M "I am a farmer, and I have the natural interest that the agreements of the Assembly be carried out," he says. M In his office in the House of Representatives we met with the President, Mr. Tous Soto, (who, referring to the "statement" authorized by the "Association of Farmers" and published in our yesterday's edition), concerning a certain telegram sent by Mr. , Tous Soto to the "Local Agricultural Boards" which is qualified by the Asoj ciation of Farmers as "an ■ intrusion of the "Speaker" in matters which are not his concern", i expressed himself in the following therm;nos: j "The telegram is true. I am a farmer, and I have a natural interest in seeing that the agreements of the Assembly are complied with, precisely so that bodies that are not, and should not be political, refrain from being so."
