HUYKE OPPOSES ELIMINATION OF ENGLISH INSTRUCTION DURING THE FIRST FOUR YEARS .
. M - HOLDS THAT THE PEDAGOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RAZONS MUST BE HARMONIZED J é ,-- ' M 'Those who criticize my recommendations to the Legislature are wrong in attributing to me purposes that I do not have,' M
Don Juan B. Huyke, Commissioner of - Public Instruction, made the following statements to us yesterday, answering several questions we addressed to him: - "I was yesterday explaining before the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, the modifications and economies which I have proposed to the budget of ; public instruction. I have said, and I do not have to repeat it, that I am not asking for reforms of any kind, I am only indicating them in case they are necessary in these times of acute economic crisis. Those who criticize them are wrong to try to attract from me purposes that I do not have. How can I 'want to deprive the Puerto Rican youth of higher education? My desire to save the right of teachers obliges me to seek less inconvenient solutions. In the "Finance Committee" you have the opportunity to hear the Treasurer, Mr. Gallardo, express the hope of obtaining during the current fiscal year the money necessary to cover the budget as it is at present, with the reforms he recommends. If these predictions of the Chief of the Treasury Department come true, there will be no need to reduce the instructional budget. However, I have recommended these savings in good faith, so that the Legislature may consider them and work with them in mind. I believe that the School Lunchroom appropriation will not have to be eliminated in its entirety. The Equestrian Commission has given me
The Riding Commission has given me more than $14,000 this year, which I will dedicate to the support of this Service. The tuition will not have to be that which I recommend, but that which the Legislature deems reasonable." "The motion is not to resort to public sentimentality. No one in Puerto Rico wants the reduction of our edv cative work, and we all agree that we must go forward in our endeavor to raise up a youth prepared for the struggle for es-stence." -What do you know, Mr. Huyke, about the inPorm of the Commission which studied our educational system? "It is true, I am aware, that said commission recommends teaching in Spanish during the first four years of elementary instruction, but if you, remember in my report to the Legislature at the time this question was being discussed, I recommended that all subjects be taught in Spanish in the first three years, leaving only English as a special asig nature. The daily minutes devoted to English in the first four grades ' do not cause any harm, on the contrary, they produce immense benefits to Puerto Rican children. It has been made public that most of our boys attend school for only four years. We should not, therefore, take advantage of the opportunity we now offer to study English, knowledge which is necessary for the development of our children.

THE GOVERNOR. WILL NOT AT THIS TIME FILL THE POSITION OF PRES. OF THE COM. OF CIVIL SERVICE
M So we were informed yesterday in Fortaleza. M Candidates whose names are being bandied about. M Yesterday we were informed in Fortaleza that Governor Towner does not intend to fill for the time being the vacancy which occurred in the presidency of the Civil Service Commission, on the occasion of the exaltation of Mr. Terry to the sub-chief of Instruction. - . The Executive Secretary, Mr. Saldaña, told us that the Governor has not yet decided who will be appointed to the position in question, since other matters of greater importance urgently require his full attention. In spite of this, some Senators with whom we have spoken are of the opinion that the Governor will send the aforementioned appointment to the Senate during the current extraordinary session. Among the candidates for the chairmanship of the Civil Service Commission, the names of Messrs. Andreu, present Secretary of the Commission, Rafael del Valle Pitjem, Vatie and Tolyson are strongly mentioned.
Mayor Todd has con ferenced with the Governor regarding the new municipal budget.
M ALSO HAS CONSULTED WITH THE INTERIM ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE AUDITOR M An interview with Martinez Nadal. -M Difficulties with the Assembly. M On the occasion of the Ordinance passed by the Municipal Assembly of this city, whereby the Mayor is instructed, to put into effect the new budget approved by the Assembly in one of its last injuries, and on the occasion of the decree issued by Mr. Todd, addressed to the various heads of the Municipal Departments, ordering them to conform to the previous year's budget, it seems that the dis- , crepancies between the Chief of the Municipal Executive and the Assembly have intensified. Yesterday morning ury> of our editors went to the offices of Mr. Todd, with the ■ purpose of ascertaining what would be his actii tude in regard to the ordinance of i 1 ¡ the Assembly, but the Mayor refrained from comment- , gano. He only confined himself to telling us "that he was studying the matter," continued on p. 5a.-la. colm.

WE ARE TRYING TO REMOVE ALL THE REGULATORS FROM THE 'GUAGUAS'.
M- This is recommended by the 'Traffic Committee' of the Public Service Committee. M- Dr. Figueroa will propose it at next Tuesday's meeting. M At the recommendation of the "Traffic Committee", the "Public Service Commission" will consider at its meeting next Tuesday, several amendments to the regulations governing passenger transportation in the municipality. Apparently, the Commission wants to avoid an increase in the number of "guaguas", due to the current traffic congestion. The "Traffic Committee" of the "Public Service Commission", which studied the advisability of suppressing the current system of regulators, recommended the suppression of the current system of regulators. i.

M Statements by Cordova Davila. M Last night we received the following very important cablegram from the representatives of EL MUNDO in the United States: Washington, July 9.-Although Congress failed to take action on the appointment of an official Board of Inspection to tour the Philippines, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, some members of Congress, mainly Senators, have announced their intentions to go independently, as semi-tourist travelers.
