FINALLY AUTHORIZED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER OF ELPRES. COOLIDGE Cablegrams to this effect were received yesterday by the Governor and Colonel Estes.
Colonel Estes received yesterday a cablegram from Washington informing him that President Coolidge has signed an executive order authorizing the continuation of the extension of Salvador Brau Street. Governor Towner has also received an official dispatch to this effect, in which it is further stated that the President's Resolution came as a result of a report made to him by the Governor of the Virgin Islands, Captain Trench, who is at the same time the Senior Chief of Naval Affairs of the United States in Puerto Rico. Since the concession requested by our authorities to be able to carry out the extension of Ja "Salvador Brau" Street included certain military and Navy lands, there was a need for the extension of Ja "Salvador Brau" Street.
i military and Navy lands, it was necessary to obtain the approval ■ of the Secretaries of War and Navy, who delegated Mr. Estes and Mr. Trench to recommend what should be done. From the first moment Colonel Estes reported favorably on the concession requested for the extension of Salvador Brau Street.

ANTONIO R. PARCELO TELLS US UPON HIS ARRIVAL FROM STO. DOMINGO "The Puerto Rican feels there as if he were in his own country," he declares.
that they begin to develop their leading men". "The Puerto Rican feels when he arrives there, as if he were arriving in his own country. No difference in language, in customs or modes of character; equal defects, identical virtues: a whole so similar, that there is no equal between two other peoples of the earth." "I was received and entertained in such a manner, that I owe that people immense gratitude, and Puerto Rico has undoubtedly received through these courtesies and tokens of affection and sympathy, a demonstration of what it can expect from the Dominican people in the relations it is called upon to maintain with them, as a supreme necessity of its life." "The peasant lives happily in his hut or bohío fenced with palms, also covered with palms or . yaguas as in Puerto Rico, but more spacious and generally with more "comfort". He owns the land he wants, and cultivates it with love, knowing that it is his and his children's, and that it is for the time being free from other dangers. The cane worker there, is the Haitian and the hybrid product of the Virgin Islands, who works for anything and eats any oosa. But the Dominican does not see -LIGA INSULAR-' SUNDAY, DEC. 12, 1926.

SHELL Gasoline Has Unbeatable Reputation Among People Who Know No one better able to determine the goodness of any product than the person who uses it and puts it to the test. SHELL gasoline always yields the same good results, which translates into LESS EXPENSES to maintain your car. LET'S SEE some testimonials from well-known mechanics:
LINO PEREIRA, aviator and former head of the Mechanical Department of the Panzardi house, says: Whenever I have had any dispute with automobiles, I have filled my car's tank with "Shell" gaso'ina and I have been able to obtain a 15-mile greater mileage than with any other brand of gasoline. L. SIERRA: owner of a mechanic shop in Parada 15 and one of the most competent and well known mechanics in Puerto Rico tells us: My car gets oil in the sparks and I notice that when I use "Shell" gasoline I have to clean it less frequently than when I use any other kind of gasoline. This is the reason why I only use "Shell" gasoline. F. ANGRELO, head of the Repair Department at Panzardi and a recognized authority in the automobile industry, tells us that for several years his cars have been using "Shell" gasoline and because of the results obtained he has decided to continue using it as it is the best gasoline currently available on the market.
the best on the market. He effectively recommends the use of "Shell" gasoline to his clients and friends. P. HERNANDEZ, another of the best known mechanics in San Juan and whose services are in great demand, informs us that: He uses "Shell" gasoline exclusively because it produces less carbon and has more force, needing, therefore, less acceleration, contributing this to make the consumption of gasoline more reduced. SEGISMUNDO VIDAL, owner of a mechanic shop in Martín Peña, and with recognized experience in the repair of automobiles recommends effectively to all the owners of automobiles of Puerto Rico the use of the gasoline "She'J" for better 1 ' operation of the motors. ANTONIO LAGO; recognized mechanic with 18 years of experience and owner of an accredited workshop in Martin Peña, says: My opinion as a mechanic is that any engine using Shell gasoline develops more power and gives more miles per gallon than with any other gasoline.
There is something even more conclusive to prove to you the superiority of SHELL; on your next trip fill up your tank at Rafael Ruiz Soler's service station, -in Martin Peña- and take note of the higher performance per gallon of gasoline. SHELL _
