The Rotary Club of Mayagüez asks the Legislature to investigate the College of Agriculture.
It also requests that it be separated from the University, "from the influences of Benner, and from the negligence of the "Board of Trustees". He commissions legislators Perea Fajardo, Arsenio Martínez and Sabater to handle the matter.
Our correspondent in Mayagüez transmitted the following telegram yesterday: EL MUNDO, San Juan. The "Rotary Club" of this city, at its last meeting, agreed to authorize the following report: The "Rotary Club" sent a commission from its bosom to study the existing conditions in the "College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts" of this city, composed of Messrs. Boothby, Grau, Souffront and Guzman Jr. This commission rendered a written report, which has caused deep uneasiness among the "Rotarians". It was concluded that the culprit in this movement was Chancellor Benner, who counted in advance on the inattention of the "Board of Trustees" of the University, and the Board of Trustees was accused of having permitted such a state of affairs, in order to thus, among others,
The Board of Trustees was accused of having allowed such a state of affairs, in order to discredit the institution, for example, by allowing a bachelor in philosophy to teach mechanical engineering. The Agronomy Department has no plants, the Electrical Engineering Department lacks proper workshops, and the whole College is a sham, which has not collapsed, thanks to the natural talent of its students. Such said one ( of the gentlemen of the committee. The Club urged the "Rotarians" Perea Fajardo, Arsenio Martinez, and ' Jose Sabater, legislators, to request the Legislature to make . an extensive investigation of the t College, and to separate it from the Uni- , versity, from the influences of Mr. . Benner and from the neglect and incompe- ( tence of the Board of Trustees." Such is the document authorizing the "Rotary Club" of Mayagüez. t F. PAGAN MEDINA, , (Correspondent.)

i Says Barceló, commenting on the Willis project to create a Ministry of Overseas. "Any change at this time may bring fatal conse'I cuencias to our people," he adds.
- We published yesterday a cablegram, q we received informing us that Sen. Willis has introduced in Congress, a bill creating a department to attend ex elusively to the possessions of the United States which implies the creation of a civilian agency to administer, among others, the governments of the Philippines and Pto. Rico. Yesterday we visited the President of the Senate, Don Antonio R. Barceló, from whom we requested a comment on the referred bill. Here are his statements: - "I am not going to discuss the matter from the honorable point of view that such a project may mean for Puerto Rico, because anyway a civilian department always "dresses" better than a military one, but I have really lost sight of the fact that I have lost sight of the matter of finding out where the reactionary men of the United States are, and I am not going to discuss the matter from the honorable point of view that such a project may mean for Puerto Rico.
reactionary men of the United States, and where the liberal men are. Perhaps a liberal element may be found in a group of reactionaries and vice versa, and any change at this time when our problem is to be discussed, may have fatal consequences to our people, for we may pass into a Bureau composed of and directed by men who do not know our true situation, who have no experience in those questions which most intimately affect us, and which we are continually raising before the national powers. I fear finally," Mr. Barceló tells us, "that I will find myself with reactionary men, dressed in civilian clothes, more reactionary than those who wear military uniforms".
