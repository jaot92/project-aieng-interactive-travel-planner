' "IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ABOLISH ENGLISH. HOW COULD I GO ALONG WITH IT IN ITS ERROR?"
M "MR. YORDAN KNOWS THAT HE WILL FALL WHEN NECESSARY IN DEFENSE OF MY IDEAS" M "He cannot expect any different attitude from me on this occasion."-Huyke M
We published yesterday an article by ♦ former Representative to the House, Mr. Joaquín D. Yordán, where he commented on certain statements made by Commissioner Huyke at the Economic-Social Congress. Mr. Huyke, made the following statements yesterday, in reply to those of Mr. Yordán:- "Former Representative Yordán, re-produced part of my words pronounced at the Economic-Social Congress, which shows that he did not penetrate the spirit of the whole concept. I will act," I said, "as a Puerto Rican, and there is no doubt that if the Legislature wants, as I do, the Puerto Rican to learn Spanish and English, we will find a skillful way to express the mutual desire. "In my concept, this is acting as a Puerto Rican. If the Legislature were to abolish the teaching of English, how could I join it in its mistake? Mr. Yordán knows that I know how to fall when it is necessary to fall, in defense of my ideas, and he cannot expect a different attitude from me on this occasion"! I went to Congress to speak against Mr. Vincenty's information, which deprives 84 percent of the Puerto Rican population of learning English. I did not have the opportunity to speak, but I hope to do so before the Legislature, before which all those concerned in this matter must appear." -Have you been called before the Legislature to present your views," we asked. -No, but I hope that Bernard will. I am willing to brief the Legislature on this important issue, to bring the legislators to our schools to appreciate the beautiful work we are doing."

CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMISSIONER OF I N S TRDCCION L A SRA. LUZ MARIA RAMOS
M Mr. Huyke offered him cooperation in selecting teachers to go to Panama. M Mrs. Luz María Ramos, an educated Puerto Rican lady, who has come to the country on a special mission from the Government of the Republic of Panama, where she holds the position of Inspector General of Home Economics, held an extensive conference with the Commissioner of Public Instruction, Mr. Juan B. Huyke. Mrs. Ramos informed the Commissioner of her mission to select on the island some teachers of mathematics, English, Spanish and domestic science to teach in the normal and secondary schools of Panama. Mr. Huyke, in turn, offered the distinguished lady his full cooperation in carrying out her efforts in Puerto Rico, also promising her the help of the Department in this task. In the Commissioner's opinion, there will be no difficulty whatsoever in selecting competent professors to successfully perform the professorships offered by the Government of Panama. Mr. Huyke believes that there are on the island a sufficient number of teachers properly prepared in mathematics, Spanish, English and the other subjects referred to by Mrs. Ramos, who would be willing to go abroad. We are pleased to announce that we have received a letter from the Queen of the Carnival of San Juan, to the gentle sovereign of the carnival festivities of the Dominican capital. Don Rafael Colorado, with whom we have talked about this matter, informs us that they expect to make the trip in two and a half hours of continuous flight, without counting, as it is natural, the time necessarily spent in landings.

"WE HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL LEGISLATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR DEMANDS".
M "WE WILL NOT GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO FIGHT ANY PROJECT THAT MAY INJURE THE AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY" M Says the Secretary of the "Asociación de Agricultores", Mr. Landrón M
Yesterday we spoke with the Secretary of the "Asociación de Agricultores de Puerto Rico", Mr. Enrique Landrón. - What is your opinion-we asked-about the Eco-nomic-Social Congress?"-"As far as we are concerned," he told us, "we attended to defend the memorial we addressed to the Legislature, and to support the views of the "Farmers' Association" in connection with the economic problems under discussion. "We hope that the Legislature, taking into account our aspirations, reflected in our message, will legislate in accordance - with our demands. Naturally I q. we will not give up the right to fight any bill that is presented, which may injure the agricultural interests of the country." -Will you submit to the Legislature any special report, setting forth your views as to how to deal with the latifundia problem? - "If the Legislature needs and two.

Judge Wells considers it probable that the Congress will grant the vote to the Puerto Rican woman. M El Ledo. Lopez de Tord is in favor of restricted suffrage M . (From our Editor in Ponce) M We have conferred with the Hon, Judge Wells, of the Federal Court, who is in the performance of his duties in this city. I.# we questioned him about women's suffrage, and asked him if he was in favor of granting the vote to Puerto Rican women. He immediately answered: "No. I don't see why not. The Puerto Rican woman is as well prepared as the man. Their collaboration in the public affairs of the island can and will give good results.
There is a legislative environment to extend the activities of the "Puerto Rico Tobacco Agency in New York".
The project will have the support of the "Farmers' Association" --M The idea is stirred up among several legislators to extend the activities of the Puerto Rico Tobacco Agency in New York, which is today under the direction of Mr. Francisco Linares, to other fruits that may be exported from Puerto Rico to the North. The purpose pursued by those who favor this plan is to make an intense propaganda abroad in favor of other products of ours, just as is being done at present with our tobacco. In this way, they believe that the interests of coffee growers, fruit growers, and farmers engaged in the cultivation of small fruits can be protected, as is currently being done with tobacco growers. The bill, if presented, must have the full endorsement of the "Puerto Rico Farmers Association". This entity has made suggestions to the Legislature in this respect. It is not that we are going to point out the way to solve it, we will simply be able to give our help to study the problem, which is a difficult one indeed". We put other questions to Mr. Landrón, which he refused to answer despite our insistence".
EXPRESSION OF CONDOLENCE I wish to express my deep gratitude to all the good friends of this town and of the island in general for their condolences on the occasion of the tragic event that occurred to me with the unexpected death of my dear daughter Lolita in a car accident. As there have been so many letters and telegrams received, it would be a very laborious task for me to express to each and every one of my good friends my gratitude for their demonstrations of affection and for that reason I extend it to all of them through these lines, signifying that I am highly grateful for their feelings of mourning, because it is always a consolation when demonstrations of distinction and friendship are received in the supreme hour of grief.

"IT IS A GREAT SATISFACTION FOR US THAT THE CHAMBER HAS DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE US".
M "IT WILL MAKE OUR SERVICE KNOWN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO SEEM TO BE MISINFORMED" M Says the President of the "Trolley Company", Mr. Giles M
Mr. Carl C. Giles, President of the "Porto Rico Railway Light and Power Company" dictated to us yesterday the following statements, commenting on the investigation requested in the House by Representative Romani, and agreed to by that body, with respect to that company : "It is a great satisfaction to us that the House of Refreshers has agreed to submit us to an investigation, to determine whether the various public service departments of this company are operating in accordance with the franchise obtained. "Thus the country will be able to know the concessions we make to our subscribers, and especially to the municipalities. "It is true that due to the back debt for public lighting that some municipalities had pending payment for months and months, we had to adopt drastic measures, but our attitude was the result of the failure in which our efforts to collect from these municipalities culminated. We had extended the payment date and granted several extensions. After trying our best to get the defaulters to pay, the company came to the conclusion that it had to act vigorously to get the municipalities in question to honor their contracts. We do not believe that it is a crime in Puerto Rico for a public utility to take extreme measures to co : Lrar its money after exhausting all conciliatory formulas that could be put into practice. Municipalities should pay their debts honorably, just as an honest man would do, even more so when he is put in a position to do so, and is put in a position to do so.
The municipalities must pay their debts honorably, just as an honest man would do, even more so when he is put in a position to do so, and extensions are granted again and again. "We are not only satisfied that a Committee of the Chamber should investigate the operation of this company, but we would be intimately pleased to have the Chamber of Commerce, and the neighbors of the city and of the Island, as well as any association or body of a public or private character, join in that investigation and become acquainted with our proceedings. "We are operating in a fair and honest way, equitable for the consumers, for all concepts. Our lighting and electric service could not easily be improved, and our rates are lower than in any other part of Hispanic America. "We are continually making improvements in service, both in transportation and lighting, and if our equipment and service is not better, it is because we are prevented by the limitations of our present franchise. "Reasons are these to rejoice in an investigation, wherever it may come from, because it is evident that it will make known our service and the procedure we employ in our business, for the benefit of those who seem to be misinformed."
