THROUGH THE SENATE PEREA FAJARDO REQUESTS CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY.
M He wants various information sent to him concerning the "College of Agriculture" M **Yesterday, at half past eleven o'clock in the morning, Mr. Barceló occupied the presidency of the Senate, and called the Senate to order. Only the Secretary, Mr. Hernández López, Mr. Iriarte, Mr. Guerrero, Mr. Perea Fajardo, Mr. Fuertes, Mr. González Mena, Mr. Jordán and Mr. García Ducós responded to the roll call. Mr. Barceló stated that there was no quorum, declaring that it was regrettable that the Senate could not hold a session for this reason. He said that the senators should appear at all the meetings of said legislative body, because otherwise it would be censurable that the work would end in absolute failure. -If the presidency has lost the moral force, I am willing to decline the post," said the Senate President. He added that the time announced for the opening of the session was ten o'clock in the morning and that since then he had been waiting for a "quorum" to begin the day's work. At twenty minutes to twelve o'clock Senator Juan Bautista Soto arrived and a quorum was obtained. A few minutes later, Senator Martinez Davila entered the room. The previous minutes were approved. The following petitions were read: From José M. Gutiérrez Figueroa, of Santurce, requesting the revaluation for a reduction in the value of the properties covered by the Safe Homes Law and that they be allowed to pay any amount they may have, outside of the rental fee established by said law. From the "Respectable Lodge Hijos de Borinquen", Fajardo. Requests that Section 291 be amended, in the sense that it be exempted from the payment of property taxes (Continued on pg. 17).
SENATOR GUERRERO PROPOSES THAT A DIVORCE SUIT MAY NOT BE FILED UNTIL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE.
Oscar Guerrero introduced the following bill in the Senate yesterday:- "Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico: "SECTION I.- That Articles 159, 165, 168 and 173 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico are hereby amended, so that they shall read as follows: "The husband shall be the administrator of the property of the conjugal partnership, unless otherwise stipulated. "The purchases made with said property by the wife shall be valid, when they refer to things destined for the use of the family, in accordance with the social position of the latter. "However, the immovable property of the conjugal partnership may not be alienated or encumbered, under penalty of nullity, except with the express consent of both spouses. "From the date on which a divorce suit is filed by either of the spouses, the administration of the marital property by the husband, who may not exercise any act of administration without the consent of his wife, shall be suspended. In case of disagreement, the district court shall decide what is convenient to the interests of both spouses. "Article'165. Divorce may only be granted by trial in the ordinary form and by judgment rendered by a district court. In no case may divorce be granted when the cause on which it is based is the result of an agreement or conspiracy between husband and wife, or of an acquiescence of either of them 1 to achieve it. "Except when the cause of action for divorce is adultery, no suit for divorce may be brought within five years after the marriage, and in any case, the party suing for divorce shall not be entitled to a divorce within five years after the marriage, and in any case, the party suing for divorce shall not be entitled to a divorce on the ground of adultery.
1 Sen. Zeno is in favor of Congress authorizing our Legislature to regulate the possession of land. He says that the law is being violated "at the insular executive's discretion. M Senator Zeno has filed a concurrent resolution in the Senate to request the United States Congress to grant the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico the power to regulate and limit the ownership of land in this island by corporations. The aforementioned legislator alleges that in spite of the provision of our Organic Charter with respect to the limit of land ownership by corporations, í "these have acquired quietly and peacefully and with the knowledge and patience ■ of the Island Executive Power and its judicial officers, and have been possessing and exploiting lands in extravagant amounts that exceed the constitutional limitation". He adds that "it is evident that the greatest difficulty presented to the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico to be able to remedy the evil lies precisely in the rigid circuit to which the provision of our Charter reduces it. Finally, Senator Zeno requests that the Congress of the United States be requested to grant to the Legislature of Puerto Rico the power to regulate and limit freely in this island, the possession of land by corporations. 1 - The person must have resided in the Island of Puerto Rico for at least two years during the last preceding year. ) for the whole of the last year preceding the filing of the suit; and unless the cause of action in which the suit is brought, the

ROMANI IS WILLING TO DEFEND THE PROJECT BY REGULATING THE LAND.
M In reply to certain statements made by Representative Lastra Charriez in connection with the latifundia project, to which he alluded, Representative Romani made the following statements yesterday: I "It is not accurate that I have aulo- ; rized with my name the project on latifundia. I remember that a few days ago Mr. Barceló spoke to me about this project, requesting my opinion and assent, and of course I expressed my full con- ■ formity, although I suggested the convenience of some amendments to clarify ' better the purposes of the same. "After this, other colleagues of mine in the House have subscribed to the project, and have presented it, but as I said before it is not authorized by me. This is not to say that I do not agree with it, for I am willing to sustain and defend it on the floor. "Now, as to the statements of my friend Mr. Lastra, that this project is only intended to create an atmosphere for the next elections and deceive fools and the unwary, the distinguished representative well knows that I have never been accustomed to exhibit myself with parliamentary boasts that could provoke criticism and ridicule. I have always presented few bills in each Legislature and that is why I have been fortunate that all of them have become laws."PROVIDED, That in all divorce suits the court shall transfer the case to the District Attorney before rendering judgment, so that said official, in representation of the People of Puerto Rico, who are hereby declared to be an interested party, may intervene in the proceeding, if he deems it convenient.
