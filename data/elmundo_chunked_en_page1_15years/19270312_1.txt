Senator King entered the Governor's office yesterday, at a time when an editor of "EL MUNDO" was talking to the private secretary of the Chief Executive of the Island, Captain Van Deussen, with exquisite courtesy, greets us and takes a seat next to us. Senator King is very kind and courteous, and when Captain Van Deussen tells him that he has arranged for him an interview with Mayor Todd and another with Colonel Estes, according to his wishes, he expresses his appreciation and thanks him again and again. "You are very kind," he says to him. "I am sorry to be obliged to trouble you so much and interrupt you in your work. Call my attention to me as soon as you see that I am disturbing you. -You never intrude here, Senator," Captain Van Deussen replies, "on the contrary, I am glad to be of some use to you. We spoke to Senator King,
and asked him about the state of his health. We knew that some of the members of the congressional committee, including Mr. King, had been feeling somewhat ill after his arrival. "I was sick all day yesterday," Senator King tells us, "and the doctor came to see me about four times. What is the name of that gentleman, Captain Van Deussen? Ah, Dr. Ashford, yes, and of course, because he has visited me so often, I feel much better now. (As he says these last words, Senator King smiles slightly)". Captain Van Deussen interrupts the dialogue to ask the Senator what time he wishes to see Colonel Estes. -Any time that is convenient for him. This afternoon? Very well, I will go to see him. My purpose is only to greet him, as well as Mayor Todd." From Colonel Estes' office Senator King is then invited to a reception to be held at three o'clock in the afternoon at the White House, and the Healer accepts, but not before asking Captain Van Deussen: "But will I have to wear my dress pants, tailcoat and top hat?
No? Very well, I'll go then. By the way, Captain, I want to know if there are any good tailors in the city, because when I packed my personal things in Washington, I didn't put everything I needed in my suitcase, and now I find myself with a suit that is quite large, and another that needs mending. So I have q. to buy a few pants, and have a suit made to measure. Do they make good ones here?" -Yes, indeed," replies Captain Van Deussen, "but wouldn't it be better for you to buy (Continued on p. 6).

CONGRESSMAN KIESS TOLD US, WHEN WE INTERVIEWED HIM IN FORTALEZA M He does not yet want to venture his judgment on the elective Governor.
We had an interview in Fortaleza with Congressman Edgar R. Kiess, Chairman of the House "Insular Affairs Committee," just as he was finishing a lengthy conference with Governor Towner. As he greeted him, he said: "I have already seen in THE WORLD the report of our arrival; it is very good. "I wanted to tell you that we need some issues of your newspaper. I alone need at least six copies, because I want to send some to Washington". After telling him that it would be a pleasure for us to oblige him, we asked him what impression he had already been able to form of our country.
impression he had already been able to form of our country. "Admirable, we are completely satisfied. This morning we visited the schools of the city and we were amazed at the progress and advancement of instruction in Puerto Rico. The bilingual teaching constitutes in this island something marvelous. "What impressed us most, especially me, was the new building of the "Escuela Superior Central", of such beautiful architecture, so complete, so well conceived. The student body was gathered in the assembly hall, and I had to say a few words. Perhaps I could not express what I really felt, as I was overcome with emotion. You can say that from the visit we have made to the schools, we have been very well impressed. Our opinion of the educational development on the island is very favorable. "As for the progress evidenced by the city, all that can be said is too little to commend its industrious inhabitants. I never knew that there were so many commercial establishments, of effective value, solidity and credit, in San Juan. I have been very impressed. I was in Puerto Rico about fourteen years ago, and of course I have been very much impressed with the quality of the water.
The development and progress that is noticeable in all the activities of the life of this town". -Do you favor in these moments the concession of the elective Governorship for Puerto Rico? ? - "That's one thing of what iu (Continued on page 8)

"MR. BARCELO'S WORDS AT THE UNIVERSITY IMPLY A CHALLENGE TO OUR GOVERNMENT."
M "IT IS ABSURD TO ASSERT THAT THE UNITED STATES MAINTAINS A STATE OF TYRANNY AND COLONY IN PUERTO RICO" M "Those gimmicky speeches, pronounced to win applause, are pure nonsense for us": Congressman Brumm M
At eleven o'clock in the morning, yesterday, we moved to the "Hotel Conda-do-Vanderbilt". In the program of festivities prepared in honor of the American congressmen, an official visit of these gentlemen to the public offices of the insular and federal government was consigned. At the hotel, we met the Representative to the Insular House, Mr. Walter Me K. Jones. He was chatting amicably with several American legislators. He asked us to supply him with a copy of yesterday's edition of EL Mundo, in which we had published the full text of the
in which we published the full text of the speech delivered by Mr. Barceló at the "University of Puerto Rico", during the congressmen's laughter at the aforementioned center of instruction. -Would you subscribe to these rations made by the President of the Senate," we asked Mr. Me. K. Jones. -Of course I would. The congressmen seem to have misunderstood Mr. Barceló's statements. Last night, Mr. Guerra Mondragon and I (Continued on page 5)
