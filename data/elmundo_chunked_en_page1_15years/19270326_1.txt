Dr. Betances, has given honor and brightness to the name of Puerto Rican.

HUYKE INSISTS THAT HIS DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET BE INCREASED BY $800,000. BY $800,000
M "I am delighted with the speech of the President of the Senate," he says, referring to the part concerning Instruction. M Yesterday we met with the Commissioner of Public Instruction, Don Juan B. Huyke, questioning him on various problems related to his Department. In answer to questions we put to him, he said: - "There is no doubt that the problems of education are solved in Puerto Rico with money, as the Educational Commission of Columbia was able to appreciate. "We have asked for an increase of $800,000.00 for our budget with which we can carry out our work satisfactorily. "This amount does not represent any increase, considering that in past years it has been reduced because of economies. "We need more rural and graduate schools. We need to create the Research and Sanitation businesses. We need to put our Inspectors in better economic conditions. We need sewing and agriculture teachers. "We rejoice in the speech of the President of the Senate at the banquet in honor of Secretary Davis, announcing the duty of the Legislature to continue to further this work of progress in which we are all engaged." What are his impressions so far?

We were informed yesterday by the president of the corporation, Mr. Luis Toro M He denies that the recent transaction with Congress Cigar could affect the price of tobacco.
| M A small quantity of the collected cigars is in condition to be stored. The first tobaccos received are of very inferior quality and a large part of them are unusable for the manufacture of cigars. The tobaccos now being received appear to be of better quality than the first received, and it is impossible to appreciate the quality of the crop until it has been fully harvested. -As to price...? "As to price, I can tell you nothing at present, as this will depend on the kind of tobacco and the demand for it on the market. -What is the situation of our tobacco in relation to Cuban tobacco in the U.S. market?

"THE ARGUMENT OF THE [LITER ACY IS ALREADY TOO WEAK".
M "IT IS ALREADY SEEMING TO US SIMPLE EX CUSA IN THE LACK OF BETTER REASONS FOR NOT ATTENDING TO OUR DEMANDS" M This is the opinion of the president of the "Asociación de Maestros, Mr. Sellés.
We have questioned the President of the Teachers' Association of Puerto Rico, Mr. Gerardo Sellés Sola, in the margin of the speeches delivered at the tribute of the Legislature "1 Secretary of War, during which the problem of instruction in our country was alluded to again and again. -What is your opinion as to the statements made at the bre the visits of the Congressmen and the Secretary of War? - "Very satisfactory as to the schools. The children eloquently demonstrated their interest in school and their knowledge of the subjects taught. All the visitors appreciated Spanish and English classes of which they gave me the best impressions."
I was also impressed by the banquet in honor of the Secretary of War by the political leaders of the country as far as public instruction is concerned? -It excites me to think that all agree to continue to work effectively for public education. The legislators and leading men of Puerto Rico must have one satisfaction, and that is that they have not needed anyone to push them in the excellent work done for the benefit of the country. Now, they have encountered serious obstacles, some of them very powerful, in such a beautiful task. Right now the issue is whether it will be possible to continue the constructive process. Our Legislature is moved by the dreadful problem of hundreds of thousands of children without schools, threatened by ignorance, sickness and disease.
