invoking 'socialist radicalism' now is a pretext to cover up the real reasons why the Alliance cannot or will not fulfill its program.
M "Legislation must be passed to extinguish the evils of absenteeism and to undertake the adjustment of land 'control'":-Iglesias M aí IF THESE LAWS ARE VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR, THE LEGISLATURE MUST PASS THEM OVER THE GOVERNOR'S VETO," SAYS M
W One of our editors visited Senator Santiago Igle sias yesterday at his Santurce residence. At the time we entered his living room-library, the Socialist leader was writing a manifesto in connection with the Fifth Congress of the "Pan American Workers Confederation" to be held shortly in Washington. When we informed him of the purpose of our visit, which was none other than to obtain a comment from him on the statements of Messrs. Tous Soto and Sanchez Morales inserted in yesterday's edition, Mr. Ig'e- , sias gave truce to his work in order to please us. He immediately began to dictate to us the following statements :- "There is talk that the solutions suggested by the labor organizations and the Socialist Party to undertake the reconstructive work that Puerto Rico needs are so radical in character that they cannot be put into practice by the Alliance. Well, in this case, the Alliance should withdraw from power and let other parties and other men assume the responsibility of raising in núesI EL FUEGO FORTALEZA 61 '' ' JARABE |MlíKl|DENEÜÍiAU01 a í Jl ■ JARABE DENECHAUD Combines the origi* nal French formula of the eminent Dr..

and" tra Legislature the solutions that the Alliance rejects so that new men would vigorously and courageously undertake these reforms now described as radical, but which perfectly served the electoral objectives. In Europe, as in America, when the parties or their leaders do not feel inclined to confront situations analogous to those suffered by the people of Puerto Rico, then they resign and abandon the work of the "committee", which will be able to continue its work.

"THE STRIDENCIES OF THE ALAR MISTS S 0 N HARMFUL TO THE TOBACCO HARVESTERS" M * "WHAT PRUDENCE INDICATES IS THAT THESE RESIST UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT AS LONG AS THERE ARE NO REMUNERATIVE PRICES."
- M ' Says the "Association of Farmers" in response to certain criticisms
iv The Farmers' Association of Puerto Rico authorizes the following notes: - "Covert enemies of the Farmers' Association have tried to deny the latter its legitimate participation in the defense of the interests of the tobacco growers. It is useless for the Association to hide from these so-called defenders of the long-suffering farmers of the aromatic leaf. It knows who they are and what interests they are serving. "To deny the work that the "Farmers' Association" has been doing in this regard cannot be
VI ciendo in this regard can be nothing but IGNORANCE or BAD FAITH, and those who hide their name to tarnish the reputation <Te this body have both. "Since it was founded, a little less than three years ago, the Association has been preaching the union of tobacco growers for the defense of their interests against all their natural enemies. In this propaganda, the men of the Association toured the towns of the tobacco producing regions, enlightening the harvesters of tobacco.

| REMIGIO RELABRA IN "EL MUNDO" THE SECOND PART OF HIS LIFE.
Don Angel Rivero, the very entertaining writer whose very short pen has earned him a place of honor in our letters, resumes in the next Sunday edition of EL MUNDO the very interesting narration he has popularized under the name of "Remigio" or "La Historia de un Hombre" ("Remigio" or "The Story of a Man"). * Remigio" will relate from the columns of our newspaper, with the wit that characterizes him, the second part of his life, sprinkled with events of intense interest, which will captivate the reader's attention from the first moment, and which will make him wait with real anxiety for Sunday mornings to savor such an exquisite literary delicacy. Our thousands of readers are therefore in luck. "Remigio" is preparing to tell tomorrow, Sunday, the first day of the second part of his life, in which well-known characters of the city and some events of the day are admirably combined with the emotional notes of the past.

M greso, visited the Caga Blanca to discuss the matter with the President. Representative Kiess stated verbally that he was favorably impressed with the progress made in Puerto Rico. He said further that, in his [conversations with businessmen and other leaders, he discovered no serious problems, nor did he encounter any anti-American sentiment. The Puerto Rican people are loyal to the United States," said Repre- , sentant Kiess. 'Gov. Towner is very popular, and he is ha ! cing a good governor. "We find that Puerto Ricans are in a hurry when it comes to spending money. That's how they've gotten into debt. However, they are now moderating their spending." "Representative Kiess said further, that the big problem for Puerto Ricans, with a population of one million four hundred thousand and a territory of three thousand square miles, is finding jobs." : Stenographer In English and Spanish with experience, we need an .

M gives the Coalition. I am absolutely convinced that any such agreement or conversation between Messrs. Barceló and Iglesias would have been immediately notified to me by the latter. Therefore, I deny the possibility that this rumor is true". Referring to Mr. Tous Soto's statements published in yesterday's edition, where the President of the House accepts the responsibility of not having discussed the projects related to absenteeism and latifundia, Mr. Martinez Nadal told us the following: "This is an ostensible and clear challenge from Mr. Tous Soto to Mr. Barceló. That is to say, if these slight con- cerns on absenteeism and latifundia did not come to the House for discussion, it was because Mr. Tous Soto's criteria was opposed to those laws and that is why he carried out a true act of underhand dictatorship, shelving them under the key of his presidential desk. Nothing else could be expected from Mr. Tous Soto. Fallen in the Alianza, fallen in the Puerto Rico Union Party, fallen in the Puerto Rican Republican Party and fallen in public opinion, he necessarily had to grab hold of something and he fell on the back of the great vested interests of Puerto Rico.

ON VACATION EM BOAT YESTERDAY THE AUDITOR HOLCOMB M He states for the record that he will not confer with the national authorities M Yesterday embarked on the military transport, bound for New York, the Auditor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Frederick G. Holcomb, who in union with his lady wife intends to remain at the home of his parents in the State of Maine, for four weeks. Moments before Auditor Holcomb embarked, we were able to interview him, and on inquiring the cause of his journey he made the following representations:- "My journey is purely private; it obeys no other purpose than that of resting for some time from the hard labors of my office. "I shall remain in the North for four weeks, and will return to Puerto (Continued on p. 6. Col. 1.).
A In this capital there has lately circulated with considerable insistence the version that Messrs. Barcelo and Iglesias, presidents, respectively, of the Union of Puerto Rico and Socialist parties, had held a conference from which the probability had arisen that both parties would be united in the next elections. In this respect we had an interview yesterday morning with Mr. Martinez Nadal, President of the Pure Republican Party, who in answer to our questions expressed himself as follows: - "I do not believe that this is possible. To even suspect it would be a heeha injustice to Mr. Iglesias' well proven loyalty and to the principles on which he was founded.
M "IT IS TIME ENOUGH FOR OUR GOVERNMENT TO HAVE THE PRIOR CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE" M "IN THIS EMPLOYMENT WE MUST SET ASIDE SMALL AND INFECIOUS RIVALITIES" M This is how Ledo Bolívar Pagán, vice-president of the Socialist Party, expresses himself.
M Mr. Bolívar Pagán sends us the following article: THE FUTURE GOVERNOR. -From echoes in the American press, and from news and rumors circulating, it seems that storm winds are blowing around the Executive Mansion of Puerto Rico. It seems that from the high official circles of the Nation the probability of an early change in the governorship of Puerto Rico has been insinuated.
I to change in the governance of the Island. The insinuations and rumors have been embodied in information from authoritative newspapers of the United States, which we have at hand, and in recent cable news, and in official statements originating in the spheres of the Government in Washington.
