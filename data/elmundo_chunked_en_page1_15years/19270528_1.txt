THE DECISION IN THE CASE "BROWERS" YS. "NEW YORK & ALBANY LITHERAGE CO. WILL NOT AFFECT PUERTO RICO
That is the opinion of the Interim Attorney General, Mr. López Acosta.
The Treasurer of Puerto Rico believes that it is the Department of Justice that is called upon to give its opinion as to the possible effects of a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the collection of taxes in Puerto Rico. New York & Albany Litherage Co.", which interpreted section 250 of the Federal Internal Revenue Law of the United States, in the sense that the "five years" statute of limitations for tax claims refers not only to judicial proceedings but also to administrative and executive proceedings, when the collection of taxes through such proceedings is involved. According to this decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, when the statute of limitations elapses in years from the date on which the tax return was filed, the statute of limitations is consolidated in favor of the taxpayer, and the government cannot, either judicially or administratively, collect the taxes so prescribed.
The belief has been expressed that such decision also affects the collection of taxes in Puerto Rico, based on the fact that, as far as taxes are concerned, federal and island laws contain analogous provisions. If this criterion is correct, the Treasury would be faced with the problem of seeing its income considerably reduced. Treasurer Gallardo has declined, as we have already said, to comment on the Supreme Court's ruling, telling us that it is the Department of Justice which, in his judgment, must inform us to what extent it affects the insular tax system. The Acting Attorney General, Mr. J. A. López Acosta, in commenting on the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to which we are referring, has stated that although there is a certain similarity between Jos federal and island statutes as far as taxes are concerned, the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court has not yet been applied to the island tax system.

"It is of urgent necessity that in Puerto Rico the teacher's salary be raised to the maximum amount that can be paid."
"When this is not possible, we should not even think of a reduction."-This is how Selles Sola addresses the Governor, advocating that he sign the instructional budget as approved.
The President of the "Asociación de Maestros de Puerto Rico", Mr. Selles Sola, addressed the following letter to Governor Towner yesterday: - May 27, 1927. Hon. Horace M. Towner, Governor of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Sir: The People of Puerto Rico have expressed through their Legislative bodies, through the press, through their public and private institutions in general and through the voice of their citizens rich and poor, of medium or wide culture and from the highest to the humblest social spheres that they wish to maintain the instruction of their children without detriment and that they wish to extend it in an intelligent and progressive manner in order to place in their hands the most notable instrument of modern civilization: a cultivated intelligence.
Thousands of letters and telegrams have reached your hands, all inspired by the same ideas and the same sentiments, and we have never rested in our request that the people be given these things that legitimately belong to them, once they have received them, once they have received them, once they have received them. On June 7, 1927, at 10 o'clock in the morning, the auction for the construction of the Plaza del Mercado de Puerta de Tierra, San Juan, Puerto Rico, will be held at the City Hall Building, in the Office of the Mayor, in a public act. The bidding form, instructions to bidders, bidding documents and other information related to the works, are available at the Office of the Director of Municipal Public Works, and copies of the documents may be obtained by means of a receipt certifying that each interested party has deposited in the Office of the Municipal Treasurer of San Juan, the amount of $10.00, which will be reimbursed upon the return of all the proceeds of the bid.
We further come to Your Honor as Chief Executive of the Administration to request on behalf of the teachers and children of Puerto Rico that you sustain the legislative action as far as public instruction is concerned, although we believe we are fully justified in stating that those items devoted to public health, to the promotion of agriculture, commerce and industry as well as to providing the interior districts of the island with adequate means of communication should also receive from Your Honor the most careful consideration because these things and nothing else are the things which are to save Puerto Rico. We wish to repeat here a number of reasons in support of the budget for public instruction which are in the minds of all educators and which are in good condition within twenty days after the auction has taken place. The Auction Board may reject any or all of the bids submitted and reserves the right to award the contract to the bid deemed most advantageous, even if it is not the lowest in price.
