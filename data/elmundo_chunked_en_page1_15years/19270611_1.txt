REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES TO TAKE EFFECT IN SAN WAN TOMORROW.
M- M City employees protest that they are being prevented from participating at the polling places --M Mayor Todd says in this connection that "an outrage" has been committed M 'Among most of the municipal employees of San Juan, the opinion prevails that the head of the Pure Republican Party, Ledo. Rafael Martínez Nadal, exceeded his powers by dictating the rules that will govern the celebration of the pure Republican primaries to be held tomorrow in this capital. This attitude of the municipal employees is motivated by the fact that among the rules dictated by the pure republican Chief, there is one that prevents them from serving as secretaries or judges at the registration tables. Mayor Todd has told us the following in this connection:- "The rules of the party contain no part which would have (Continued on p. 11, Col. 7) ; Clerk Wanted Young man of good appearance, about 25 years of age, who speaks and writes English and Spanish, with some experience in the 'sale of electrical goods.

M f P0R CAPTAIN CHARLES A. LINDBERGH) (Exclusive rights in Puerto Rico for EL MUNDO.- Copyright by "New York Times Company"). LONDON, June 1,-One of the most intense disappointments of this trip of mine to Europe has been that of not being able to study carefully the progress of aviation in all the nations of the continent. There is no doubt that the United States has, in the matter of aviation, a great deal to learn from the old continent. The development of the art of flying, as an element of warfare, has been developed much more rapidly here. And to convince oneself that the progress of their commercial aviation is greater than that of America, one has only to study one of the maps describing the regular air routes of Europe. Since, forced by circumstances, the national airlines of Europe have been able to make a significant contribution to the development of their commercial aviation, the European aviation industry has been able to make a significant contribution to the development of their commercial aviation.
Tous Soto suggests an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that he believes harmonizes all Puerto Rican political ideals.

Such a measure would determine the admission of overseas territories as states.
(From our editor in Ponce) c , M t The Speaker of the House of 1: Representatives, Ledo. José Tous c Soto, suggests an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which would reconcile the dignity and privilege of statehood with the economic advantages of the Canadian type of self-government. He is of the opinion that this solution harmonizes all the existing political-economic ideas on the island. The proposed amendment could constitute, in the speaker's opinion, the formula of the national policy of ultra-continental expansion s "If it were accepted - says the Ledo. Tous Soto- by the Puerto Rican public opinion embodied in its political parties, it would be submitted to the study and criticism of the universities and statesmen of the North and later to the conventions of the great national parties, which are to be held next year. I would be very grateful," Mr. Tous Soto concludes, "for the study and criticism of the proposed plan, provided that we do not lose sight of the fact that the question is being raised.
that the question is placed in the field of pure political science and not in the narrow plane of partisanship. We are looking for a solution of the so-called American colonial problem, to which it has not been turned away after (Continued on p. 5 Col 4) GREAT TRIUMPH OF ROYAL GREGG M COLLEGE Miss Bonnie Hickle has passed with excellent marks the United States FEDERAL SERVICE examinations and has been appointed to a high post in Washington for which she embarked in recent days.
