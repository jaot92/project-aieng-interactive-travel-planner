By Lieutenants Lester J. Maitland and Albert F. Hegenbergen. (Exclusive publicity rights in Puerto Rico for "EL MUNDO''. Copyright by "New York Times Company''). M HONOLULU, July 6.-It was now two o'clock in the morning of the 29th. We had descended in half an hour from 10,000 to 4,000 feet, owing to a malfunction in the carburetor of the center engine caused by the frost in the clouds. As our involuntary descent progressed, the temperature gradually rose. The carburetor ice melted and the engine regained its usual power and performance. We soon climbed again to 7,000 feet, passing through the dense clouds. Penetrating them one by one we succeeded in placing ourselves at an altitude where starlight often reached. As we had reports of our latitude from Polaris, and as, moreover, we did not wish to reach land until morning, we reduced our speed to sixty-five thousand an hour. The wind was blowing from astern and, if we did not slow down, it was probable that we would be able to reach land by morning. 4

"Has Mr. Barceló tried to prove that there is error on our part?" Thus expresses the Secretary of the agricultural entity. Ledo. Pesquera
The Secretary of the "Asociación de Agricultores", Lic. José L. Pesquera, authorizes the following article: - REASONS VS. EFFECTS "The last General Assembly of the "Asociación de Agricultores", when approving Resolution number 12, declared, implicitly, or what follows: 1st That the Puerto Rican people have the right of suffrage, which was granted to them by the Organic Charter that governs us; "2nd That the Legislature of Puerto Rico, constituted by men who obtained our votes to vote for us, has the right of suffrage.
That the Legislature of Puerto Rico, constituted by men who obtained our votes to defend the rights of the people, has the power to legislate in electoral matters, regulating and assuring the privilege of suffrage; "3rd. That our legislators, obeying the partisan pressure that Mr. Barceió himself exerts in the name of a very misunderstood discipline, instead of making use of the power to regulate and secure the sacred right of suffrage, have arrogated to themselves the power, which no one has granted them, to practically destroy that right, reducing it to the whim of the chief and his associates;
"That a chief and his cronies whose custom is to do their will, above the will of their party and of the people, will not lend themselves to the approval of the necessary amendments so that Puerto Rico may have an electoral law that will allow it to eliminate the obstacles that impede its happiness; "5o. That faced with the dilemma of leaving in the hands of the chief and his allies the electoral weapon, with which they constantly wound the rights and interests of the true people, or restoring it to the latter, so that they may wield it in accordance with their own will, and in accordance with their own interests;" Continued page 12, colm. 3.
