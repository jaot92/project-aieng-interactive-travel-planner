"10 S GRADUATES OF OUR UNIVERSITY WOULD DO WELL TO FORM THEIR ASSOCIATION".
M-- "But once constituted they should come with their concerted efforts to sustain it in spite of the obstacles": Barceló M
The President of the Puerto Rican Senate and of the Board of Trustees of the University, Mr. Antonio R. Barceló, has made the following statements to the "Propaganda Committee" that questioned him regarding the advisability of forming the "Association of Graduates of the University of Puerto Rico": - "The idea that is stirring among the graduates of the University will represent, once embodied in an activity of sure orientation, a great step forward in the progress of our first educational center. I am only sorry that it has not been initiated sooner. But the fact that it has been initiated with the flattering prospect of a fruitful realization, shows how the graduates of the University feel the concern of the problems which their "alma mater" has before it. "To strive to invigorate, to affirm sea the spiritual contacts that create you in the pleasant days of
university life, contacts that are weakened as a consequence of the forced separation that follows the academic graduations, is, in my opinion, the most plausible management that can give happy culmination to the youth that in the generous classroom nourished its intelligence laying, hopeful, the foundations of the future full of triumphs". "A group of young professionals devoted to a noble goal, dedicated to contribute in a fruitful collaboration plan, to the development of our university, removing obstacles, smoothing rough edges, making their way with their will, must necessarily constitute the crowning of the homeland culture. It is good, then, that this group be organized, synthesizing the efforts of all in a single effort. There is no human quality that is more important to develop in our youth than the solidarity that stimulates the will of all the members of the group. 4
n PUERTO RICO'S TREASURER ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF WITH AMPULOSE PHRASES, WITHOUT FOUNDATION
"HERE THE CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN THEY WANT TO" M--- Says the Municipal Assembly of Yabucoa
In response to recent statements made by the Treasurer of Puerto Rico, Mr. Juan G. Gallardo, the Municipal Assembly of Yabucoa authorizes the following official note: - "It seems that our Resolution No. 48 published in the press has reached the bone of the Treasurer of Puerto Rico and now he is trying to justify himself with pompous phrases, without foundation. We do not intend nor do we wish to sustain polemics in the press. Our purpose has been to call to order so that greater attention may be paid to the sources of Municipal Revenues in the hands of the Island Treasurer. We need not prove to the country a thing known to every person of average culture in Puerto Rico: "That here corporations pay their taxes when they feel like it without a strong hand to make them conform to the law.

Rico we have been suffering the consequences of these tolerances. Hence the numerous Borrowing Ordinances that the Executive Council processes annually. "When this Municipal Assembly resolved to adopt the Resolution that has annoyed the Treasurer so much, it did not do so without first being duly documented with official data from our municipal offices, letters from the Island Treasury Department itself and our efforts to ensure that it was duly documented.

ADDRESS OF THE "PUERTO RICO PUBLIC AGENCY IN NEW YORK. RICO IN NEW YORK
M The "Economic Commission" of the Legislature, at its last meeting, discussed very slightly the advisability of establishing in New York the "Puerto Rico Public Agency in New York. The Committee discussed very slightly the advisability of establishing in New York the Puerto Rico Publicity Agency, which shall have an exclusively informative character, to make known in the North those matters which most directly and especially concern us, to make an intense produstry, and to furnish such information in favor of our most important interests as may be required by any corporation or entity interested in establishing any business or industry in Puerto Rico. And they also spoke about the convenience of offering the position of Director of said "Advertising Agency", in case it is established, to Mr. Luis Muñoz Marín, presently Director of "La Democracia", alleging his knowledge, extensive culture and vast knowledge of the problems of the country, as well as his good relations in the North and his mastery of the English language. The matter, which was only briefly discussed, will have to be considered at the next meeting of the "In sular Economic Commission". And it is most certain that the position to which we allude will be offered to our learned colleague, Don Luis Muñoz Marín. DR.

"I WANT A GOOD ELECTORAL LAW SO THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE PEOPLE WILL WIN" M Dke Martinez Nadal in reply to Don Juan N. Matos.
The President of the Pure Republican Party, Ledo. Rafael Martínez Nadal, authorizes the following "statement" answering manifestations of Don Juan N. Matos, Vice-president of the "Farmers Association", which appeared in one of our previous editions :- "Unfortunately in Puerto Rico personalism reigns in all discussions and that is why in them argument does not appear anywhere, which is substituted at times by irony of more or less bad taste, others by personal aggravation and others by the fallacy of attributing concepts and phrases that did not even fleetingly pass through his mind to the opposing debater. "I have never disparaged any of the gentlemen who figure in the ranks of the so-called Living Forces. On the contrary, I have had and have for them the highest personal consideration. I dispute their purposes, but I do not question their prestige and personal merits. "Because this has been so and is so, I am forced to rectify the gentleman Mr. Juan N. Matos, who, no doubt because of the hyperesthesia produced by his battle against politicians, has forgotten that I have always treated him with affection, respect and seriousness, and that the least I am entitled to is similar treatment on his part. "Would Mr. Matos be so kind as to have me reproduce the words or writings of mine where I have stated that the men who constitute the Fuerzas Vivas are pelagatos? "I could not do so, because I will have said and surely have said that the Fuerzas Vivas are not numerous, and I have stated and do state that if they go to the elective polls with the postulato de
But this can in no way be interpreted by any sensible and impartial person as an affirmation that the men of the Fuerzas Vivas are lame ducks. My assertion, Mr. Matos, referred to quantity, not quality, which are, in Spanish, two very different things. "Mr. Matos, with a manifest prejudice that incapacitates him for the direction of opinion groups, assumes that my ardent desire for a good and democratic electoral law is the son of a pedantry that leads me to the belief that I am omnipotent and must be generous in giving permission for the so-called Living Forces to fight and witness their defeat. ''Bad system is to think badly of all men, Mr. Matos. I wish for a good electoral law, as a matter of principles deeply rooted in me. "I want it so that those who have the people's endorsement will win. If the people want your policy, let it come in good time and it will have my compliance even when I discuss and fight it democratically under the protection of a just and good electoral law. "Mr. Matos unfortunately contradicts himself when he lists me among the politicians who feel caressed by the smiles of their supporters and the adulation of the grateful speculators of checks and perks, after hurting me with the irony that "alludes to my triumphs" -read defeats. Where do we stand, Mr. Matos? If I have had nothing but defeats and I have always belonged to a minority party that has never been able to implement its policies, what is the point?

A QUESTION FROM LCDO. 1RIARTE TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS OF SAN JUAN
It refers to a certain auction for the acquisition of piping for the new aqueduct. M We entered the office of Ledo. Celestino Iriarte in search of some information and he told us that he had only arrived there a few minutes ago and opened his desk, but that he would be glad to oblige us:- "Here I have on the desk today's EL MUNDO," he added, "and on the first page I see an auction announcement from the Municipality of San Juan for the acquisition of 1350 tons of 30'' diameter cast iron pipe-Class "D"-for the works of the new aqueduct, and although I am not an engineer, I fortunately have a good memory and remember well what I have read. That is why I looked up this other issue, also of EL MUNDO of April 20, 1927, to read again what engineer Montilla said on that date and I find that he said the following: "The value of the additional material to which I refer comes to $126,000.00 and we will have to acquire it since there was unpredictability on the part of the previous administration in the purchase of the Belgian pipe, to such an extent that if we were to use only the pipe purchased by the Unionists, it would not resist the pressure of the water. We have outlined a plan whereby by purchasing a certain amount of pipe to withstand "higher pressure", and building some spillways, we will prevent the excess pressure from bursting the pipes ®and leaving the city without water." "As the Unionist Administration had purchased pipe of
How is it possible, if you are fair, to include me in the responsibility for the blunders and immoralities of which you speak, and to suppose me imaginatively a distributor of mercies and perks, and a conqueror of smiles and genuflections of base flattery?

"CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS HARMONY BETWEEN THE "TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION" AND THE DEPARTMENT".

"RARELY HAS BARCELO BEEN SO RIGHT" M-"I don't know what a tangent is. I always like to go straight and to the point": Pesquera. M . El Ledo. José L. Pesquera, secretary of the "Asociación de Agri cultores", commenting on the statements made by Mr. Antonio R. Barceló in yesterday's edition, dictated these brief lines: "Rarely has Mr. Antonio R. Barceló been so right. What he says this time is true: I do not know what a "tangent" is; I always like to go straight and to the point", 30" of classes "A", "B", "C" and "D" to resist the different pressures to which it was going to be exposed and the engineer Montilla says that "there was lack of foresight on the part of that Administration when acquiring the pipeline", it occurs to me to ask him in what does this lack of foresight consist?If at this moment, August 11, 1927, the acquisition of 1350 tons of pipe is being announced at auction, how was it possible that in April 1927, Engineer Montilla and Mayor Todd informed the people of San Juan that the aqueduct would be finished in the month of May of last year?
We requested yesterday from the Deputy Commissioner of Public Instruction, Don Francisco Vizcarrondo, his opinion on the harmony that exists at present* mind between the "Asociación de Maestros de Puerto Rico" and the De" parlament of Instruction. Mr. Vizcarrondo made the following statements in response to our question:- "There is nothing more logical than to view with pleasure and immense satisfaction these harmonious relations between the "Teachers' Association" and the Department of Public Instruction. There is no more important factor in resolving the questions that arise in life than time: it makes us forget old resentments, it dissipates personal quarrels, it places us on a plane from which all situations are judged and analyzed coldly, serenely, dispassionately. And it makes us turn our eyes to reality. It is the experience that speaks to us, and will make us think better about our future actions." "Congratulations on this harmony between the "Association of Teachers" and the Department. And may it not be ephemeral for the good of the public instruction of the country and for the benefit of the school. The school year that will begin shortly, will have to be prodigal in happiness and goodness. I "Working in perfect harmony and inspired by a frank spirit of cooperation, the University, the Department and the "Teachers' Association", we will conquer triumphs this year. May God grant that this omen may not be spoiled by fatality. "The teachers will always find me here, ready to serve and help them in every possible way."
