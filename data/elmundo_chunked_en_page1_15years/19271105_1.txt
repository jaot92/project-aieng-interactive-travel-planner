"I doubt very much that the present optimism can prevail, unless the sacrifice that the restriction of its harvest represents for Cuba finds an echo in those countries that manufacture sugar for export.
countries that manufacture sugar for export." "While, by restricting its 1926 and 1927 harvests, Cuba has achieved better prices, the cost of its production has been higher, inasmuch as, both in plantations and in machinery and exploitation, expenses were incurred for a much greater production than i*ermitted in those years.

of San Juan in the next general election? -Jesus, don't even think about it. I wouldn't dream of it. And with the Municipal Law in force, much less. Any man of criteria that goes to the Mayor's Office is placed between a rock and a hard place with that Municipal Law we are suffering. Take this example. Mr. Carbia has filed a certiorari against the San Juan Municipal Assembly. The attorney for the Municipality, at the request of the Municipal Assembly, submitted his opinion regarding the matter and that opinion is not at all in Mr. Carbia's favor. The Municipal Assembly received the opinion of the attorney of the municipality, acknowledged the same and agreed to go to trial. This morning I had a conference with the attorney for the Municipality. He maintains the opinion he rendered to the Municipal Assembly. In his files there is not a single argument against Mr. Carbia.
