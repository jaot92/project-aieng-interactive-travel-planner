--M For that purpose meets the Executive Committee M Tomorrow Sunday, at 10:80 A. M. the Executive Committee of the next Carnival will meet in the City Hall of San Juan in order to proceed to the election of the Queen who will be the sovereign of the festivities. As it is known this year the system has been changed resolving that it is the Executive Committee the one that chooses the Queen and not the public. Given the importance of tomorrow's meeting, it is expected that not a single one of the gentlemen who make up the aforementioned Committee will be absent. - He spoke of the Iberian spirit in Puerto Rico, and highlighted "its enduring solidity of rock, against which all the onslaughts of exoticism crashed, impotent. He then referred to Noel, and praised his apostolate of renovation, his dynamic yearnings to renew with new sap our Spanish face.

EUGENIO NOEL'S MASTERLY LECTURE WAS LISTENED TO
Amidst a fervent silence at the end of the lecture, a delirious round of applause burst forth.
. ■"IV Almost completely full last night was the "Teatro Alunicipal" for the announced inference of the eminent Spanish novelist Eugenio Noel. Both the stalls and the double horseshoe of boxes, were, at the time set for the start of the event, overflowing with a very select audience, composed of prominent figures from núes tro literary and social world. The Columbia University's brilliant recognition of his mentality and of his magnificent work as a tribune and lecturer, which we extend to the country for honoring him as one of its preeminent sons.
The old coliseum was graced by the presence of numerous ladies. It was a feast of the spirit full of sensation and brilliance. When the illustrious speaker appeared on the stage, he was greeted with a thunderous applause. Don Luis Llorens Torres made the presentation of rigor, extending in details on what represents our distinguished guest in the modern Hispanic mentality. With a warm emotion of conviction, the poet Llorens made the silhouette of the spirit of the race, immortal and invulnerable through the times. He spoke of the alternatives to which he had been subjected.
When the budget for instruction was discussed at yesterday's hearing, Huyke asked for an increase of $1,845,858.
Do you think it is prudent to grant this increase in a single year," Auditor Holcomb asked. Huyke requested that teachers be paid for 11 months of the year.
In the office of the Auditor of Puerto Rico, Mr. Frederick G. Holcomb, the public hearing announced to discuss the budget of the Department of Public Instruction that will govern during the next fiscal year was held yesterday at two o'clock in the afternoon. No one appeared at the hearing to oppose the increases requested by Commissioner Huyke in his Department's appropriations. The hearing was attended by Commissioner Huyke, the Deputy Commissioner and Secretary of the Department of Public Instruction, Mr. Martin, the General Superintendent of Rural Education, Mr. Pedro P. Arán, Mr. Ramón Alfartr and Mr. Harriman, and all argued in favor of the requested increases. The officers of the Department of Public Instruction, upon questions from Auditor Holcomb, stated that it was essentially indispensable to intensify education in the rural area of Puerto Rico, and that for this purpose they needed appropriations that would permit the realization of these purposes. -We need," said Mr. Huy ke, "to develop in our fields complete systems of instruction, as well as in the towns. Gradually we have been establishing fifth gradQs in the rural areas of the country, then we have been able to establish sixth, seventh and eighth, but the latter are very- few. We cannot deny them a right to which the children of our countryside have been entitled. Mr. Auditor, President Coolidge's statements to Congress on the deficiency of our rural education tell us that we must do something more" for the children of our countryside." Commissioner Huyke requests in his proposed budget an increase in the salaries of the teachers and officers of his Department, corresponding to $1,665,000.
The overall increase he is requesting over the current fiscal year's budget, including salary increases and new appropriations, amounts to $1,845,858. Mr. Huyke requests that salaries be paid to teachers for eleven months of the year. Mr. Huyke further requests an appropriation of $50,000 for the support of night schools to teach illiterate adults to read and write; that the appropriation which existed two years ago be restored for the payment of 45 agricultural teachers, 45 teachers of physical culture, special teachers of sewing, embroidery, drawing and music. 'Requests that the appropriation for the purchase of books and materials be increased from the current $100,000 to $200,000.
He requested one for the scientific equipment of the Central High School and for the purchase of new machines for the Commercial Course offered on that campus. Mr. Huyke recommends an increase in the salaries of the school inspectors and principals and also requests the creation of several positions in his department. Messrs. Martin and Aran argued extensively in favor of the increases requested by Mr. Huyke. The creation of new rural schools was another of the points discussed at yesterday's public hearing. At the conclusion of their arguments ' the officers of the Dept, of In"-; Continued on page 23 4th. col. '
