M Selles Sola says alluding to the new plan for the collection of tuition fees that the University is considering.
The President of the "Asociación de Maestros", Mr. Gerordo Sellé Sola, made the following statements in relation to a report that appeared in "La Democracia" about a new plan for the collection of tuition fees at the University: - "This matter requires a careful study by the Board of Physicians. We have requested the President of the Board of Trustees of the University to give the Puerto Rico Teachers' Association the opportunity to be heard by the Board of Trustees.
of Puerto Rico the opportunity to be heard by means of a Commission before a final decision is taken on the matter In my opinion, the plan proposed is in complete disagreement with the spirit of the law creating a special fund for the University, In short, it would place a new obstacle to that part of the university's youth which lacks the resources to meet greater expenses.
