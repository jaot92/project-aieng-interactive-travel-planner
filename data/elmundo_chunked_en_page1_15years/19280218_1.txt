"THE GOVERNOR AFFIRMS THAT THE SYSTEM IS THE CAUSE OF THE MUNICIPAL CONFLICT IN SAN JUAN AND HE IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
I am against the suggestion of depriving those who cannot read and write of the vote", says M "THE CAUSE OF THE CONFLICT IS MR. ROBERTO H. TODD": MARTINEZ NADAL M "I am against the suggestion of depriving those who cannot read and write of the vote", says M "I am against the suggestion of depriving those who cannot read and write of the vote".
We have interrogmh" to! President of the Puro Republican Party, Lic. Rafael Martinez Nadal, on his opinion regarding the Governor's message to the I.egisla. i ara. Lic. Nadal, in relation to some of the points recommended by Mr. Towner, made the following statements: "On the question regarding the "Commission of Laborers, it was absolutely necessary for the Governor to submit it to the Legislature, because given the bankruptcy situation in which that body finds itself, the Legislature would have had to intervene on its own initiative.
"As for the suggestions on the election law, the one about general amnesty for the electors of the year 1924 is not bad. But really Governor Towner, who sponsored the election scandals of 1924, was obliged to push through the Legislature a fairer and more democratic law. So. especially when already a Justice of the Supreme Court, the Hon. Justice Wolf, in a mandamus filed against the Executive Secretary of Puerto Rico, Cayetano Coll y Cuchí, on behalf of the Pure Republican Party, declared the present election law unconstitutional, unreasonable and void in many of its provisions".

"Rupture of relations, properly speaking, does not exist between the pure republican leadership and the socialist"
"It cannot be concealed, however, that these relations have cooled": Rivera Martínez "I BELIEVE THAT EACH C0AUGAD0 PARTY, FOR THE SOONEST, SHOULD PREPARE . WITH THE LEAST THAT IT HAS," HE SAYS.
In the offices of the "Free Federation" we greeted yesterday the Vice-President of the Socialist Party, Mr. Prudencio Rivera Martinez. The moment was propitious to do an extensive interview with the labor leader on the latest political events. The questionnaire to which we submitted him was overwhelming; and our interviewee kindly answered us in the following manner: - "Not like that, friend. Those are too many questions and made in a wheelbarrow, for me to be able to answer them almost at the same time as you pretend. If you formulate them one by one and give me time to think, perhaps I could answer some of them.
time to think, I might be able to answer some of them". And when Mr. Rivera Martinez answered us in that way, we had to accept the condition imposed to obtain his statements. And, turning on the tap of our fluency, we began our task. -¿ ? - "Rupture of relations, properly speaking, does not exist between the leadership of the Pure Republican Party and the leadership of the Socialist Party. It cannot, nor should it be concealed, however, that these relations have been strained by causes which have been accumulating since the elections of 1924. Neither personally, nor in any other way, has there been the slightest displeasure with Mr. Martínez Nadal. Mr. Mar-
tínez Nadal, President of the Partido Republicano Puro, has, as he has always had, the respect, admiration and affection of all the members of the Territorial Executive Committee of the Socialist Party. ♦ - "The proximate cause of the ens friamiento is the constant and persistent position in which some members of the Local Pure Republican Committee of Bayamóii placed themselves, to illegally snatch from the Socialists there, positions that corresponded to them in i* administration" an administration that was supposed to be coalitionist, hindering in that way the conciliatory efforts that the Supreme Board of the Coalition conducted.

"We hope that this time the good offices of such distinguished sponsors will not fail."
M Doña Isabel Andreu de Aguilar, President of the "Asociación Portorriqueña de Mujeres Sufragistas", sends us the following statements: "The "Asociación Po-torriqueña de Mujeres Sufragistas" sees with satisfaction that Governor Towner recommends of? time in his message to the legislature that the right and 1?. preparation of the women of Puerto Rico to intervene directly in our government by granting them the electoral vote be recognized. He is also pleased that the heads of the Alliance have come out in favor of granting women's suffrage in the current Legislature and that Mr. Barceló, President of the Senate, is sponsoring it with his bill (P. S 3) where he provides for it. "We hope that this time the good offices of such distinguished sponsors will not fail, so that Puerto Rico may rightly be said to be on its way to progress, and that it will not be paradoxical to strive for it, with more than half of its (Continued on p. 11, Col. 8).

In his message to the Legislature the Governor recommends that measures be adopted to amend the existing system of municipal government and suggests that special action be taken in the cessation of San Juan, alleging that it is evident that under the system by which the city is now governed it will be impossible to give the people the service which good government and effective administration demand.

To this effect two bills have already been introduced in the Senate, one to establish a government by commission for San Juan and the other establishing a special government for the capital.
