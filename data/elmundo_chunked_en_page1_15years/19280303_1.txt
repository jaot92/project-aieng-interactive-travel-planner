"WHY PROLONG INJUS TICE WHEN YOU ARE FULLY CONVINCED THAT OUR CAUSE IS REASONABLE?"
M "CAN MR. TOUS SOTO BE SURE THAT THE WOMAN IS PERFECTLY ORIENTED AS TO HIS IDEALS OF "PUBLIC POLICY" M Says b President of the "Asociación Panameri cana Mujeres en Puerto Rico", Mrs. Benet, widow of Mewton M
- ■ r Mrs. Milagros Benet Vda. de Mewton. Pre'icenta de la "Asociación Panamericana de Mujeres de Puerto Ric -', interviewed yesterday by one of our editors, commented on statements on women's suffrage by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Tous Se 4 o. which were recently published in EL MUNDO. "Of course," Mrs. Benet told us in reply to our questions, "that essentially I agree with Mr. Tous Soto, that is to say as far as granting the vote to the Puerto Rican woman is concerned. What we do not agree on is the details, that is, postponing the granting of this right to women until 1932.
Why prolong the injustice for four years, especially when one is, as Mr. Tous Soto seems to be, completely convinced that our cause is good and reasonable? The President of the Chamber alleges that the electoral machinery is already prepared and ready to function based exclusively on the suffrage of the men and that he is ready to (Continued page 12 column 4) i - ~ - - ■ - OCCASION For shipping owner sells closed car, OAKLAND, almost new, half price.

"I WILL BE AGAINST ANY LEGISLATION THAT IMPLIES PRIVILEGES" M
We have questioned the pure Republican leader, Senator Martinez Nadal, about the bill presented by the President of the Senate, Mr. Antonio R. Barceló, granting the vote to literate women. Mr. Martínez Nadal promptly replied to our question: "I am not familiar with Mr. Barceló's bill in its entirety; but I will be against any legislation that implies privilege'" for some. We must not be less than some states where there is a greater number of illiterate people in our country and where they are not deprived of the electoral right". TESTIMONY OF GRATITUDE M The spouses Ernesto López Mar tínez and Mercedes Méndez Ríos, unable to do so personally to everyone, wish to express their eternal gratitude to the persons who, by letter or e-mail, have expressed their condolences on the occasion of the death of their loving father, Mr. Manuel Méndez Dueño, Q. E. P., D, 'May the expression of our profound gratitude reach our friends' (Anuwhi).
