It seems that in the face of our de- ; bil tíamor the government amertrar ? It seems that in the face of our love the American government has found it necessary to justify to the world its conduct towards our people. This is already a ve rjtorm for Puerto Rico. The President's docuj meato is transcenü dental, and deserves a serene and meditated study".
The following article: "The President's letter to the Governor is the plea of a lawyer favoring the views of his client. It is the defense of the American administration in Puerto Rico, made by its highest representative. Reason: nothing, but full of sophistry. - Apparently equanimous, it seems to the one ■ ignorant of Puerto Rico. It presents us as bestialized before the American invasion and on the road to civilization in the next few days.

Q total fixed by the Governor has been increased by $500,000 M The Chairman of the House Finance Committee, Mr. Guerra Mondragón, informed one of our editors yesterday that the insular budget bill will be reported in the House the day after tomorrow, Monday. The alterations made to the original bill when it was studied by the Committee amount to a total of half a million dollars more than the original bill, which was approved by the House of Representatives in the House of Representatives.
The bill to create the "School of Tropical Agriculture" was approved yesterday by the House of Representatives.

was extremely brief. The public stands, on the occasion of the publication in yesterday's press of President Coolidge's letter to Governor Towner, were crowded. It was believed that the letter would be discussed in the House and hence the extraordinary crowd in the aisles and gallery. However, the matter was not discussed at all (Continued on p. 6, col. 3).
That is why our Alcoholic "Puerto Rico" has always triumphed, in the United States* and everywhere, because besides the aroma of our tropical flowers and medicinal plants being united with menthol, salicylate of soda, etc., they are dissolved in the purest alcohol, all scientifically combined and dosed, which give it its great medicinal power as well as the great richness of its perfume. The combination is very expensive; however, it is within everyone's reach. That is why so many imitators, because we give, for every penny, two, in scientific wealth.
