BILLS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR
M A measure on the San Juan port improvement plan M The Governor has signed the following bills into law: R. C. of C. 94, entitled: "Joint Resolution to pay Dr. José de Zengotita the sum of eight hundred ninety (890) dóla--es, for fees for professional services rendered to the District Court of Arecibo and for other purposes." R. C. of the C. 98, entitled: "Joint Resolution to authorize the Commissioner of the Interior to delete from the plat entitled "Improvement, San Juan Port Improvement Track and Street Layout and proposed piers'', dated March 10, 1927, and approved in accordance with Act No. 16, approved on May 10, 1927, and approved in accordance with Act No. 16, approved on May 10, 1927, and approved in accordance with Act No. 16, approved on May 10, 1927, and approved in accordance with Act No. 16, approved on May 10, 1927, and approved in accordance with Act No. 16, approved on May 10, 1927. 16, approved on May 25, 1927, the east-west street between Nos. 1 and 2 Streets, and located at 1 north on the Mira Road. Continued on page 2-col. 1 The "Rialto" broke another box office "record" M An overflowing full house of a select audience, was the one that the aristocratic Rialto Theater of this locality had last night and last night. To the wonderful Paramount movie "Beau Geste'' corresponds the merit of attracting this enormous amount of spectators. To the exit of the public it could be noticed in "us semblantes the rejoicing of having witnessed in the screen the most beautiful gpstos of the fraternal love between brothers. Its musical adaptation is simply admirable and the orchestra's teachers were highly praised by the audience. (Advertisement.)

DIDA Y HASTA UNA DESVENTURA PARA EL PUEBLO TRABAJADOR Y PARA PUERTO RICO" -M LE DICE IGLESIAS A RIVERA MARTINEZ AL INFORMARLE QUE NO SE LE ACEPTA LA DIMISIÓN COMO MIEMBRO DE LA "COMISIÓN DE INDEMNIZACIONES A OBREROS" (IN YOUR CASE, YOUR RESIGNATION WOULD MEAN A GREAT LOSS AND EVEN A MISFORTUNE FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE AND FOR PUERTO RICO).
The President of the Socialist Party, Senator Santiago Iglesias, has addressed to Mr. Prudencio Rivera Martínez, member of the "Workers' Compensation Committee," the letter which we publish below on the occasion of the resignation presented by the latter as a member of said organization to the Quorum of the Territorial Committee of the Socialist Party: April 26, 1928. Mr. P. Rivera Martínez, Member of the Workers' Compensation Commission, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Dear Comrade: The Quorum of the Territorial Committee of the Socialist Party, in session of April 25, 1928, gave ample consideration to your letter of April 18, which synthetically FLORAL PARK FIRST M The Floral Park Volley Ball Team has already beaten all the other contenders in Puerto Rico in the championship games.

(Announcement). (Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.) The following: "Being contrary to the system established by the Workers' Compensation Law, as it has been lately amended by the Island Legislature, it seems only logical to me that I resign the office to which I was reelected in the 1921 elections, and I hereby do so. "I herewith enclose the letter of resignation in English to the Governor, to be acted upon accordingly." The Quorum, unanimously, resolved not to accept your resignation, which was discussed with great interest, in order to try to establish a clear line of conduct for the future, in similar cases, which would serve as a guide for the future.

IF THE NEW INDEMNITY BILL BECOMES LAW
M The new workers' compensation bill will be challenged in court by Ledo. Bolívar Pagán M Based on the fact that the Legislature approved it after the statutory term M At the last ordinary meeting of the Quorum of the Territorial Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, the Vice-President of said party, Mr. Bolívar Pagán, was appointed to challenge before the courts, in case it is approved by the Governor, the bill to amend the Workers' Compensation Law, which is currently pending the signature of the Chief Executive. For this reason, we have been talking yesterday morning with Mr. Bolivar Pagan who informed us that in case the bill is signed by the Governor, he would immediately file an injunction to prevent it from being enacted into law. "Everyone is aware,'' Mr. Pagán told us, "that the bill to amend the Workers' Compensation Law was approved after the time at which, by specific decree of our Charter, the ordinary legislative term expired. At five o'clock in the morning, that is, five hours after the legislative work had ceased by constitutional decree, the aforementioned bill was still pending its definitive approval. Therefore, the procedure by which it was approved is unconstitutional, and on that basis I intend to challenge it before the courts".
