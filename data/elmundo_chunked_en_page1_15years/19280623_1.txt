When you decide to buy your house, or a lot where you would build, don't rush, visit all the developments and find out thoroughly about all the advances that each one has. don't rely on promises for the future, see what each one has done. and then ' THEN ' weigh one by one the following conditions: How long ago was the development inaugurated? Has it progressed significantly? What kind of construction is allowed? What families have come to live there? Does it have a public school? Does it have a playground for your children to play in? Does it provide additional free services to residents? TAKE ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION about the development that will be the site of your residence. FLORAL PARK after two years of inauguration has more than one hundred (100) selected families living in concrete residential houses (because it is the only construction that is allowed to preserve the beauty of the urbanization), a beautiful Plaza profusely illuminated, a very well equipped public school, field p;x^. play "tennis", "Basket Ball", v Volley Ball' ', being our team FLORAL PARK the champion of Veliev Ball of Puerta Rico.
