We are confident that our economic program will be accepted in its entirety by the party they represent, since there is not a "single item in said program that applies privilege to anyone and does not tend to establish reforms necessary for the happiness of all the people of Puerto Rico. 1 "The benefits to be received by the Farmers' Association by virtue of the reforms which we propose cannot be other than those which accrue to us as an integral part of the whole of Pío. Rico, bearing in mind, as we have always borne in mind, that the general welfare of a people is indispensable to the prosperity of any of the social actors which constitute it".

"THE 'ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTO-.
RES' COUNTS ON OUR ENDORSEMENT" -M-"And we will welcome any of its postulates in affinity with our principles": Barceló M
In his office of "La Democracia" we greeted yesterday the Senate Prosidcr.ie and leader of the "Aliar ía Potorriqueña ', Mr. Antonio R. Barceló. We asked Mr. Baicrló for his opinion regarding the letter addressed by the Acting President of the "Farmers' Association". Ledo. José L. Pesquera, to the leaders of the "Alianza Portorriqueña" and of the Partido Socir.'iste.-Con--tltucional pHiénucles o/ue /en included in the? respective plaiaé rmas of the mentioned political parties the economic program of the agricultural entity. The President of the Senate gave us his opinion on this matter in the following terms
The President of the Senate gave us his opinion in the following terms: -There is no problem of an agricultural nature for the good of the production of Puerto Rico and the progress of our farmers which is of interest to the "Alianza Portorr.quena" which is composed of the majority of these farmers. Already in our manifesto of March 5 addressed to the Assembly of the "Farmers' Association" we have already stated extensively all that we are now repeating, but the Board of Directors, when it meets, will bring to its consideration the common statement of the agricultural entity and will answer it in a completely satisfactory manner.
The Secretary-Treasurer of the "Asociación de Productores de Azúcar", Mr. Félix R. Hilera, has informed us that of the 42 sugar mills on the island that have milled during the 1927-1928 harvest, 32 have already finished milling and have already finished milling during the 1927-1928 harvest. Thirty-two have already finished and have rendered their corresponding report. The amount which they report to have milled is 70,620 tons of sugar. The estimates 1 which have been established for the remaining sugar is about 69,000 tons. The total harvest is likely to reach 737,626 tons, which is 1,100,000 tons more than the 1926-1927 harvest. The "Guani- ' ca" has only milled 112,480 tons of sugar this year, which represents an enormous increase over the previous production. The total of this year's crop will surpass by 80,000 tons the harvest of 1924 to 1925, the best that the island has ever had. The triumphs of the "Royal Gregg" school M Young Luis Ortiz is employed by a prestigious firm of this city two months before obtaining his diploma of Commerce M Two weeks ago Messrs. ^F. Cajrera & Bro." r ae this square, solicited, a young man from three different commercial colleges of this city to try him out and give him a position in their offices, after he had demonstrated his competence. The "Royal Gregg" Commercial College, headed by Mrs. Maria T. Camacho de Robles, sent young Luis Ortiz; two other colleges also sent their representatives; and, after the rigorous test, the student Ortiz became an employee in the offices of the above-mentioned gentlemen. And this, two months before he received his diploma of Commerce. This is a new triumph for the accredited "Royal Gregg" College, adding it to the long list of triumphs that constitute its history of highly efficient educational center. (Announcement) Dr. C. V.
