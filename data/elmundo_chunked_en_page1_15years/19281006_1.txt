|Ei each MnHdpio n* dressed the prevailing needs with the ¿1 to apply them remedy M " At four o'clock in the afternoon we visited the offices of the American Red Cross delegation yesterday. In response to questions we asked about the day's activities, Mr. Crane replied that a new supply of tents had been sent to Vieques and Culebras to sufficiently house all the homeless families who had lost their homes as a result of the season. The American Red Cross has already begun to draw up definite plans which it proposes to carry out in Puerto Rico in its relief campaign. So far it has been giving attention to the urgent and immediate needs of each municipality and has been supplying food and clothing to the ■ families in distress. It now proposes to investigate carefully the situation prevailing in each town, to ascertain the fundamental problem confronting the various mumeipa- ¡ Continued on page 11, CoL 3
THE FIRST AID SENT BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL LEGION M They have already been distributed among ex-soldiers of different towns of the Island M Talking yesterday morning with the Commander of the American Legion in Puerto Rico, Mr. Miguel A. Muñoz, he informed us of the various activities being carried out by that institution in order to extend aid to the veterans of the world war, who have suffered losses or physical damages due to the cyclone of San Felipe. "Our purpose for the present," Mr. Muñoz told us, "is twofold, that of immediate relief to the victims and that of permanent rehabilitation. Six municipalities have already sent complete reports regarding the damages suffered by the veterans residing in them. This is part of the "survey" work we are doing throughout the island. "The day before yesterday we received by cable from the United States Legion Command the sum of SI,340 and today we have sent to the persons designated for this purpose the sum of $1,00? distributed in different amounts among the towns of Yabucoa, Lares, San Sebastián, Cíales, Morovis, Comerío, Cayey, Aibonito and Orocovis, which are, according to our reports, the towns where the veterans received the most damage. "As to prcfesi> nal attention in cases of physical breakdown, we can say with satisfaction that Dr. Garcia de Quevedo who is the medical officer of the Legion Department in Puerto Rico, has offered to attend free of charge to veterans who require his services and has offered us his cooperation in obtaining the same service from other physicians in the various municipalities of the island. Dr. Biascochea also offered his services free of charge. So we hope to be able to attend to injured veterans in their own residences." - HE® I dining room v living room, for sale. !
