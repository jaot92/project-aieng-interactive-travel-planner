PRESIDENT ELECI TO, HOOVER, HAS BEEN INVITED TO VI- 1 SITAR PUERTO RICO',
I Governor Towner cabled him to that effect M As the President-elect of the Republic of the United States, Herbert Hoover, is to make a trip to Central and South America in a very short time, and cities near our island have been included in his itinerary, Governor Towner cabled the triumphant candidate of the National Republican Party the day before yesterday, inviting him to visit Puerto Rico. In the cable, the Governor expresses himself in the name of "one million five hundred thousand American citizens who would be pleased if Mr. Hoover would include our island in his itinerary". No reply has yet been received to the cablegram from the Chief Executive, but there is a great likelihood, we have been told at Fortaleza, that the President-elect will accept the summons addressed to him. | I - NOTICE - To whom it may concern: I hereby give notice that the Phoenix Insurance Company", of Hartford, Connecticut, has ceased operations since June 3, 1924, and that it is no longer in business: June 3f\ 1924, in its fire insurance business in Pueri to Rico, and des^a now withdraw the deposit it had in this department for the protection of its policyholders in this Island, upon liquidation or otherwise extinguishment of all obligations resulting from said business. í Which, in compliance with Section 147 of the Insurance Law ' in force, shall be published in English and Spanish for six consecutive weeks, once each week, in order to give all those who may have claims against said company, an opportunity to file with this office before returning the securities herein deposited. f Augusto R.

TODAY SATURDAY SPECIAL. Straw hats, for men, $1.00 DAMIAN RODRIGUEZ SACHS A CO. La Esquina Famosa.
At the commencement of the general canvass yesterday the Alliance alleged that the Board could not proceed to canvass in regard to Senators and Representatives to the House.
It was agreed to submit the matter to the Attorney General in consultation with the Attorney General in consultation with the first predate of Saa lean.
It was noted that the key belonging according to the law to the President of the Local Board of Elections was missing and that the package containing the unprotested special ballots was not sealed. It was further noted that the collation sheet of polling place number 1 was poorly written. Ledo. Bolívar Pagán proposed that the said co-sheet be declared null and void.
At half past ten in the morning, the General Canvass to be carried out by the Insular Board of Elections began yesterday. The full Board was present in the halls of the Senate where this work is carried out. Representing the political parties, the Constitutional Socialist Party was represented by Mr. Martínez Nadal, Mr. Iglesias, Mr. Alfonso Torres, Mr. José C. Marrero, Mr. Ledo. Manuel Gaetán Barbosa and Antonio Poníales; for the "Alianza Portorriqueña", Rafael Hernández Usera, Miguel Guerra Mondragon, Félix Córdova Dávila and Antonio R. Barceló.

THE REASON FOR THE SUCCESS CONQUERED BY US The general sympathy that CADILLAC and LA SALLE* have achieved is revealed by the fact that an enormous quantity of automobiles of these brands, so much in demand in Puerto Rico, for being the favorite of the aristocracy and of the stars of Art, have been sold in less than eight months. From a testimony, as enthusiastic as spontaneous, that has just sent us from Santo Domingo the admirable and charming artist Pilar Aznar, loudly applauded everywhere, we reproduce the following paragraph, which also highlights that the CADILLAC and LA SALLE automobiles are the favorites of the public.

LAST NIGHT TWENTY-TWO PERSONS WERE RECEIVED AT THE S A N JUAN MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL AS A RESULT OF AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS.
M This was reported yesterday by Dr. Moreno to the Board of Trustees.-The public works program in the city is still on the agenda M
Yesterday morning, at the usual time, the Administrative Board of San Juan met in the offices of the Warden. The session was presided over by the Acting Mayor, Mr. Conrado Asenjo, and Messrs. Moreno, Ramírez, Montilla, and the Secretary, Mr. Gaetán Barbosa, were present. First, Mr. Asenjo informed the Board that before embarking, Mayor Todd had informed him about two "tracks" for the cleaning service that had been offered by Mr. Amadeo Barletta, representative in Puerto Rico of "Cadillac" automobiles. Due to the emergency need for trucks to be used for the cleaning service, Mayor Todd had met with Mr. Barletta and the latter had promised to send the aforementioned trucks to the Municipality with facilities for the payment of the cost of the trucks.
The trucks mentioned above were to be sent to the Municipality with facilities for their payment. When dealing with the cleaning issue, Dr. Moreno stated that before buying these trucks, the use they will be put to as well as their tonnage should be taken into account, since they cannot be of great tonnage because they will have to pass a small wooden bridge to reach the crematorium, which is not resistant to heavy trucks. It was also proposed by Mr. Asenjo to consider the need to put out to auction the cleaning of different pieces of streets in Sant urce where no truck has passed to pick up the garbage since before the cyclone. This matter was discussed and left on the table as the Board believes that the Municipal Assembly of the next administration is the one called upon to take the necessary steps to clean up the streets.
