"To modify the policy followed by the government up to now": Martínez Nadal
In response to our questions, the pure Republican leader, Senator Rafael Martínez Nadal, made the following statements on the sidelines of the legislative session and at the same time of the letter written to the coalitionists by Governor Towner in response to the demands for representation in the Government: "The minority has obtained a splendid success in the Legislature and we cannot complain. We have prevented injurious acts in many ways, and several times we have served as a barrier against certain bills, and at other times we have served as a stimulus to the passage of expedient legislation. "As to Governor Towner's letter, I think he has not explicitly responded to the request of the minority and I attribute the reservation of the reply to the fact that the Government is afraid of clashing with the political ambitions of the ma-
I attribute the reservation of the reply to the fact that the Government is afraid of clashing with the political ambitions of the majority that seeks to impose its criteria on the Government by relying on a fictitious majority, which we could call technical, of three Senators, a technical majority won by the meager figure of forty majority votes for Mr. Valdés and a little more than one hundred for Mr. Tió, in the senatorial district of Mayagiiez. "At any rate, in spite of the ambiguities and evasions of Governor Towner's letter, it appears from it that there is some inclination to modify the policy hitherto pursued by the Government. This tendency toward a new policy will be accentuated as the Government becomes convinced that it must have the support of the minority in the administrative work of the Government of Puerto Rico.
