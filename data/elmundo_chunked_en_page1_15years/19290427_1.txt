/ Number 3362,"
Death penalty abolished in Puerto Rico.
The Governor signed the corresponding bill
Yesterday afternoon the Governor of Puerto Rico, Horace M. Towner, gave his approval to House Bill No. 6. of Mr. García Ducós. The law as added to our official statutes, has the effect of a commutation of the death penalty that weighs on three prisoners who are currently in the Island Penitentiary coftendados to atone for their guilt on the scaffold, since its effect is retroactive, by special provision of law. Upon signing the bill into law, the Governor issued the following statement, which explains the reasons that encouraged him to sanction the legislative action that eliminates the death penalty from our codes: "After careful consideration of House Bill number 6, abolishing the death penalty in Puerto Rico, I have approved it today. So many persons and societies have written, telegraphed and visited me.
telegraphed and visited, in relation to it, that I feel it my duty to state briefly the reasons I had for giving it my approval. "In the first place, it is no pleasure to the Governor to veto a bill passed by the Representatives of the People. Especially is this so, when the action of the Legislature is seen to appear to be the faithful expression of the sentiment of the People. There must always be sufficient and well-merited objections to justify the exercise of the veto power. In this case, after careful investigation and consideration, I find insufficient reason to justify my not imparting my approval, at present, to the bill. "The Death Penalty, as a means of punishment for the commission of murder, does not seem to be in harmony with modern civilization. To many it seems to be reminiscent of barbarism.

"Only one justification is invoked for its permanence and that is that it exerts a restraining effect on the commission of crimes of murder. Many believe that by abolishing the death penalty, encouragement is given to crime,-that the penalty of life imprisonment in substitution for the death penalty would not restrain, but encourage the impulses of the murderer. "If, as a matter of fact, the abolition of capital punishment has been tested in Puerto Rico, with the result that, during the years in which it was abolished, the commission of crimes did not increase, then there is no reason why it cannot be substituted for it on Continued on p. 11-col. 11-col 7 POLICE CANDIDATE SIZES M The Insular Police Commission will hold police candidate sizes in Caguas, on May 3, 1929, at 8:00 a. m.; in Humacao, on the same day at 11:00 a. m.; and in Fajardo, on the same day at 11:00 a. m.; and in Fajardo, on the same day at 11:00 a. m, and in Fajardo, on the same day at 2:00 p. m.; in Cayey on May 7, 1929, at 9:00 a. m., and in Guayama, on the same day at 2:00 p. m.
