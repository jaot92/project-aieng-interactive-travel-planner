"BARCELO and I WILL SUSTAIN TOWNER AS FAR AS POSSIBLE."
M "Halida consideration of whatever plans the national Administration has," says Toas Soto M - .
At length yesterday we conferred with House Speaker Ledo. José Tous Soto, on the sidelines of various current political issues. -What is your opinion on the campaign that tobacco growers and farmers in general are waging against Governor Towner's attitude of not approving the law that creates the Industrial Commission for the protection of tobacco," we asked him. -My opinion is that the tobacco growers should not rush into this matter.
This matter could well wait for the extraordinary session to submit it again to the consideration of the Legislature and in the meantime make a careful study of the bill to eliminate any aspect of it that could be open to discussion before the courts, having the additional advantage that in the meantime the Congress would approve legislation protecting the farmers and extend its benefits to Puerto Rico, in this way the legislation (Continued on p. 8, Col. 1).

"I UNFURL HIS BANNER OF LOVE AND CHARITY .... "
■ j ttlr I B ¿ n ~ Km Senator Iglesias.
Red Cross, through the American people, wiped away many a "tear" in Puerto Rico, quelled pain and remedied misery. It unfurled its banner of love and charity when the inclemencies of Nature seemed to abandon us from the protection of God and to make us doubt the possibility of remedy by man's own efforts. Her labor of love and consolation in the midst of the catastrophe that recently struck us has earned her our lasting memory of affection and gratitude. That is why now, when the meritorious inst:-
tution appeals to our feelings of nobility, altruism and pity on behalf of those who suffer, the Puerto Rican soul rejoices at the echo of the enthusiasm inspired by the overflow of gratitude towards this noble organization, which brought comfort and tranquility to our unfortunate compatriots, who in a moment of anguish were left in complete destitution, submerged in the most dreadful desolation. SANTIAGO IGLESIAS. President of the Socialist Party.

"MR. TOUS SOTO KNOWS HOW FRANK MY ATTITUDE HAS ALWAYS BEEN."
T I know that he does not expect others to always think like him," says Huyke.
Regarding a telegram from Mr. Toas Soto, addressed to "La Democracia" in which he says that the Commissioner of Instruction opposed the "A B C." project and that Mr. Tous obtained its approval through the help of the Teachers' Association, the Commissioner of Instruction, Mr. Huyke, has told us the following: "What is wrong with the heads of the Alliance? Have they lost the serenity necessary to carry out government work? In the presidency of the House there is, in my opinion, an educated and equable man, capable of considering reasonable that all men do not think as he does. But his telegram to "La Democracia" seems to indicate the opposite.
cía" seems to indicate the contrary. "True it is that I consigned in writing my opinion on the consti- tability of the A B. bill. C. I believe it to be contrary to the spirit of the organic law which places the direction of the schools in the hands of the Commissioner of Instruction. Nevertheless, I told the Governor that I could approve the bill and I believe that this grain of sand also contributed to the good success of Mr. Tous Soto. The bill has a good purpose to which I cannot oppose. When the Legislature has ceased to allocate amounts for the work of the extinction of analphalitism, I have continued to support it, and I have continued to support it.
