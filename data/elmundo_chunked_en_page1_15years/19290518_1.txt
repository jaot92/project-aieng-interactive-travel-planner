I THE OPINION OF LCDO. PERUDEZ YANGA
M On Teodoro Rooseoelt as Governor of Puerto Rico
"Questioned yesterday, the School Director of San Juan, Ledo. Epifanio Fernandez Vanga, regarding .the candidacy of Mr. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. for Governor of Puerto Rico, he expressed himself in the following terms: "The name of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. is so great, and is projected with such angularity in the history of the modern United States that, frankly, it is not possible to think of the son without referring to the father's thought. That

TO THE MOTHERS and especially to the General Public At this time of uncertainty caused by the lousy quality of milk which has been attempted to be offered for sale to the detriment of your children, we take this opportunity to call your attention to the fact that the purest unpasteurized cow's milk can in no way equal the PASTEURIZED MILK of the Porto Rico Dairy Inc. Pasteurization means reduction and elimination of bacteria and all other elements harmful to health that any cow's milk contains if it is not subjected to this process. We invite you to visit our plant, located in Urbanización del Hipódromo Viejo, Parada 20, Santurce, P. R. We are sure you will be convinced, after inspecting it, that there is no one who can compete with us in this field. If you would like us to serve you our pasteurized milk, please call us immediately at " Porto Rico Dairy Inc. Phone 2150, SanturceLIST OF SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS: . WHO CAN GIVE YOU A REFERENCE. Hon.
