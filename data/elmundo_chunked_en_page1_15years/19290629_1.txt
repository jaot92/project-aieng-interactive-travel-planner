Number 342
TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISABELA IRRIGATION.
M It will be necessary to borrow up to the sum of $l,250,000.
The committee appointed to study the problem of the Isabela Irrigation, and composed of Messrs. Holcomb, Esteves and Añeses, recommends in its report that the amount of the water canon be altered and for this purpose suggests that the following scale be adopted: for the fiscal year 1029-30, $6 per acre; for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre; for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre; for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre; for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre; for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre; and for the year 1930-31, $6 per acre, $6 per acre.
He argues that it is necessary to stimulate agricultural development in the irrigated area by providing assistance to irrigators during the first years of operation of the irrigation system. But it further alleges that such reductions in the canon would create deficiencies in the revenues of the irrigation system preventing the People of Puerto Rico from meeting the obligations incurred by the issuance of bonds made for the construction of the irrigation works and the expenses of operation and conservation of said system.

THE SHIPPING UNITS ON THE ROUTE HAVE RECEIVED ORDERS
M To locate the yacht of Dr. Franceschi Caballero M At the Executive Secretariat of Puerto Rico we were supplied yesterday with the following official note: "At the request of Governor Towner, the United States Navy Department has directed the following radiogram, through the Bureau of Naval Operations, to the Transport "Kittery" and other American units in the Atlantic, with the object of determining the situation of Dr. Francisco Franceschi Caballero. "Dr. Francisco Franceschi Caballero is at present on his way to New York, coming from Puerto Rico, on the yacht "Mary", a two-masted vessel, forty feet long and painted gray. The sea should be explored to discover it. If found, a dispatch can be sent to the Department informing the place where it is. If assistance should be needed, it should be rendered."

"After that it will depend on what the Legislature disposes," says the Adjutant of the National Guard M
Yesterday morning one of our editors held an interview with the Adjutant General of the Puerto Rico National Guard, Major Wilson. -We asked him, "Mr. Wilson, what can you tell us about the amount appropriated by the Legislature for the support of the National Guard? -With the sum of thirty thousand dollars which has been appropriated," he replies, "I think it will be impossible to support the National Guard during the year 1929-30. The expense of rent for barracks amounts to approximately twenty-one thousand dollars a year. We are thus left with a balance of nine thousand dollars to pay the salaries of 21 janitors and other expenses. The salaries for janitors amount to the sum of eight thousand dollars". -So you believe that the National Guard will not be able to continue here in Puerto Rico?
So you don't think the National Guard will be able to continue here in Puerto Rico," we said. -No. We cannot disperse the troops without the prior consent of the War Department, not even a single unit of the National Guard. I do not wish to request the Secretary of War to authorize me to disperse any organization we have at present. We propose to reduce expenses to a minimum by using every means to economize. This proves the efficiency of our organization, pnei as you probably know, the National Guard of Puerto Rico has a prominent place among the best in the United States. As an example of its efficiency I will quote to you a report of an inspection made by an officer of the Regular Army who was appointed by the Secretary of War to make a number of inspections of the National Guard, and who was appointed by the Secretary of War to make a number of inspections of the National Guard, and who was appointed by the Secretary of War to make a number of inspections of the National Guard.

GENERAL PARKER IS INTERESTED IN KNOWING
M The Bureau of Insular Affairs in Washington, of which General Parker is Chief, has written to Governor Towner asking him if the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico at its last extraordinary session passed any bill reinstating the appropriation for the payment of travel expenses of mainland teachers who are employed to teach in the public schools of the island. We are unaware of Governor Towner's response to this cablegram. But we can report that the Legislature did not take any action on this matter in the extra-ordinary session. We inquired yesterday at the Department of Instruction in this matter and were told that the Legislature had not reinstated the item referred to and that it was removed at the regular session.

TREASURER GALLARDO CONTES TALA COMPLAINT FORMULATED
M By the President of the Agricultural Board of Utuado
The Treasurer of Puerto Rico, Don Juan G. Gallardo, replies in the following terms to the President of the Junta Agrícola da Utuado: - "Appearing in the edition of the peLL1TL COS LEADERS ARE P0L1TLING -tí- The reinstatement of the suspended sanitation employees M Messrs. Barceló, Tous Soto, Iglesias and Martínez Nadal, and like them many Senators and Representatives, are receiving communications and commissions from the island requesting them to interpose their good offices tending to get those employees of the Department of Sanitation who have been suspended lately by order of Commissioner Ortiz reinstated in their positions. It is alleged in many cases that health inspectors have been eliminated, which implies the elimination of the only employee in charge of overseeing compliance with health laws, as well as the elimination of dispensary services absolutely necessary for the attention and prevention of illnesses. Political leaders have visited Dr. Ortiz at the Department of Health, and he alleges that he has been forced to adopt such an attitude due to the reduction made in his budget for the next reduction which -- BMza to the tune of "j260,000.
In the "EL MUNDO" newspaper of June 28, 1929, certain statements made by Mr. Eduardo Marin Manen, President of the Local Board of Farmers of Utuado, in connection with the collection of taxes in the said municipality by means of levy on small farmers, and in order to avoid misinterpretations, it is hereby made public in order to demonstrate the benevolence shown in the collection of taxes in that municipality, that out of the sum of $75,000.The amount of $29,000.00 of contributions receivable has been paid, and the enormous sum of $46,000.00, which with the amount outstanding from previous years, exceeds $50,000.00, is pending collection for this fiscal year.
