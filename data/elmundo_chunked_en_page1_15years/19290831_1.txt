Political actions that are of the domain of all, took that Unionist Party in 1924 to an alliance with the Republican Party, arriving this Alliance to mean in the conscience and in the mind of many, a fusion of both parties and a substitution of them. I do not wish to discuss whether such merger and such substitution came to have definite reality and legality; it is enough for me to repeat that they had it in the minds and consciences of many, and I wish to assure you that for me they did, and I expressed this publicly several days ago when invited to take part in meetings which culContinued eu page 19, col. 4

THE IDEA OF MANAGING AN ASYLUM FOR DISABLED PUERTO RICAN EX-SERVICEMEN.
Comandante Muñoz will raise the issue tomorrow at the American Legion Assembly.
Yesterday we interviewed the Commander of the American Legion in Puerto Rico, Mr. Miguel A. Muñoz, at his offices of the Public Service Commission, of which he is Chairman. Knowing the enthusiasm that Mr. Muñoz feels for his position among the Legionnaires, we did not hesitate to ask him a few questions about the event to be held tomorrow, Sunday, in the city of Juncos and about the history of the Legion in Puerto Rico. Mr. Muñoz, always attentive to com plete us, began to express himself with his customary simplicity in the following terms: "The American Legion, Departa-
The American Legion, Department of Puerto Rico, will hold its annual convention in the town of Juncos on September 1, (tomorrow). At the Convention we are going to present a very important motion in the sense that a request be made to the Congress of the United States or that administrative entity that has the authority to resolve it, that an Asylum be built and erected on our island for the soldiers who have need of this assistance. "In different areas of the United States," Mr. Muñoz continues, "the soldiers have asylums in which they can find refuge.
