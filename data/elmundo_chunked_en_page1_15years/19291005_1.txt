"WHO IS NOT NOW WHERE DON ÁNTONO BARCELO WAS YESTERDAY".
"Who allies himself with those who were his greatest enemies," says Sen. Zeno
Senator Francisco M. Zeno sends us the following article: A "LA DEMOCRACIA"... OF NOW. "A propaganda note sent to the independent newspapers of San Juan by the "Alliance Publicity Committee", gave matter to "La Democracia" to distinguish me with its editorial of yesterday. "The article that "La Democracia" dedicates to me, is nourished almost entirely by a coarse and rude vocabulary, which would excuse me from the honor of taking it into account, so as not to expose myself to the entanglement of a plebeian dispute incapable of any profit to anyone. "But the tone of bitter counterclaim that seems to throb at the bottom of some of your paragraphs, compel me to answer it with nobility. "I don't wear a suit of clothes with an austere plumage; and it certainly wasn't me.
no; and it was certainly not I who wrote that informative note, reasoned and well written, of the Alliance Publicity Committee, which by kindness of the newspaper EL MUNDO appeared headed with my modest name. But I must and I want to clarify very loudly, as a member of said Committee, that I subscribe to it in all its parts, if it in its just and full meaning does not go beyond pointing out the senseless ideological evolutions and the cruel political actions of the until yesterday admired and well loved alliance-unionist leader Mr. Antonio Barceló, in this last day of his stormy public life. "And listen to what I am going to tell "La Democracia": "The "new Alliance" has not now won Senator Zeno. "Senator Zeno, is in the Alliance, because his party, because (Continued on 11, Col. 3)

"THE OPERATION OF THE ISABELA IRRIGATION SYSTEM WAS, ON THE WHOLE, SATISFACTORY".
M The Commissioner of the Interior, Mr. Guillermo Esteí>es, says in his last annual report M
From the Annual Report of the Commissioner of the Interior, Mr. Guillermo Esteves, for the fiscal year 1928-1929, we take the following notes related to the Isabela Irrigation System:- "Hydroelectric System.- The installation of a 22,000 volt, 3-wire line over the existing 4,000 volt line from the Aguadilla substation to the Añasco River, in order to establish an interconnection service with the Mayagüez Light, Power & Ice Company, which operates a steam plant in the city of Mayagüez, was the only important construction work carried out during the year. To this effect, a contract was formalized with the aforementioned company to sell them any excess power from our system and to purchase emergency power from them. The linking of the two systems has been delayed because of various difficulties encountered in obtaining the easement for the transmission lines from the Añasco River to Mayagüez. "The Service has installed and is operating a 100-horsepower pump for the purpose of raising water to irrigate some 800 acres of land which is at a higher level than the gravity system; and also a pullzadora plant for the manufacture of limestone dust, a material which is sold at cost to irrigators for the purpose of amending their land. "During the year 109 additional connections were made to the system for the purpose of supplying electricity for power and light purposes. EXPLORATION AND.

The rainfall in the irrigation district was considerably above normal during the first half of the fiscal year and much less than normal during the second half. The same was true for the Guajataca reservoir basin. "The storm of September 13 caused little damage to the irrigation works; there were only some landslides in the diversion canal, and obstructions and breaks in the banks of several laterals, but everything was repaired immediately. This work cost $746.27. Rainfall during the storm was 11.47 inches in the basin and 8.90 in the irrigation district. "The heavy rains which fell during the first half of the year gave an excess flow to the reservoir, large quantities of water being wasted through the flushing gates of the dam. Due to the movement of the dam embankment, which we have already mentioned, and the fact that the demand for water for irrigation was at that time somewhat small, it seemed to us pru (Continued on 15, Col. 2) BOARD OF PHARMACY OF PUERTO RICO M CONVOCATION TO EXAMINATION M In accordance with the Law this Board ammeia exams for the revalidation of Chemists-Pharmacists, beginning the exams on October 16, at nine o'clock in the morning.

"It is a great danger to Puerto Rico," says Deputy Commissioner Bagué.
Dr. Jaime Bagué, Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture, answers in the following letter to Dr. A. Buitrago, of Guayama and Dr. Narciso Moreno, of San Juan: Dear Sirs: You will forgive me if I include in a single work my answer to the letter from Guayama, and through "La Democracia", addressed to me by the former and to the article in which the latter alludes to me in EL MUNDO of the 30th. I do so, because otherwise I would have to repeat arguments and as the purpose that guides us all is to shed light on the matter, I count in advance with the approval of both, since both are distinguished disciples of Hippocrates. After carefully reading the two works authorized by your signatures, I have come to the conviction that you agree with me. Back in the year 1924, in October, to be more exact, this Department of Agriculture and Labor published a circular written by me, in the introductory paragraphs of which it reads as follows : "This circular is published for the purpose of calling the attention of our countrymen to a lucrative work which leaves a large profit in other countries and which may well be adapted to our soil to become a valuable industry, or at least, a source of health and energy for our population.
.health and energy for our population. "Because of the scarcity of roads, the lack of refrigeration, the high price of the article and other circumstances known to all, the inhabitants of Puerto Rico do not eat the meat they should. Naturally, this lack of nutrition is reflected in their physical, moral and intellectual activities. The sociologists, physicians and other men of science of Puerto Rico, interested in the different aspects of this matter, have pointed out in valuable and conscientious works the evil that must fall upon us, as a people, in the near future, because of the lack of nutrition of our masses." "We have a population of 1,299,000, more or less, who have eaten during the first half of the first half of last year next year 4,388 oxen, 3,906 cows, 18,946 steers, 20,469 hogs, 2,597 goats and 266 sheep, making a total of 50,572 head of cattle of all kinds. In the same period of time the 748,060 inhabitants of the city of Boston, Mass., consumed 100,000 head of cattle and 500,000 hogs, or a total of 600,000 head of cattle, which corresponds to an average of 100,000 men suales or almost double the meat consumed in Puerto Rico during half a year.
