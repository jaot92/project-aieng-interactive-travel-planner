Don Félix Córdov" Dávila, Resident Commissioner in Washington ' THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALIANZA RETURNS TO THE ISLAND M Mr. Cuevas Zequeira will arrive in San Juan on Monday M On board the steamer "Coamo", which will arrive in San Juan next Monday, the brilliant Puerto Rican lawyer Don Rafael Cuevas Zequeira, President of the Alliance, is on his way to the island. Mr. Cuevas Zequeira is accompanied by his very distinguished wife, Mrs. Pura Penedo de Cuevas, and his charming daughter. As our readers know, Mr. Cuevas Zequeira left for the United States a few weeks ago, following the advice of his doctors who told him to take a rest. In the North, Mr. Cuevas Zequeira had to undergo a health insurance treatment that has improved him in a remarkable way, which we deeply celebrate. "EL MUNDO" wishes Mr. and Mrs. Cuevas Zequeira its most affectionate and cordial welcome. SPANISH Grapes - Raisins To make fine wines... Original barrels of 10, 20 and 36 kilos. J. M. BLANCO INC.

sent us yesterday the following statement: "From an editorial dedicated to me in yesterday's "La Democracia" I copy, among other things, the following: "Would it not be more important for our people, we repeat, that Mr. Cérdova Dávila be in his seat on the Committee on Insular Affairs, busy representing the totality of its contributors, stopping, as much as he could, the blows of our enemies, seeking data and presenting them to the respective Congressional Committees, and, in a word, fulfilling the duty of his representation, instead of being in Puerto Rico politicking in a manner so petty and unhealthy for our interests?" "La Democracia" further adds that Mr. Córdova Dávila should go to Washington to fulfill his duties, there, where our interests are orphaned of defense. "The editorialist of "La Democracia" ignores that the House of Representatives declared itself in recess as a result of having passed the bill that deals with the tariff. "The House has been extending that recess until today and will not resume its sessions until the Senate has passed the bill. The Representatives almost entirely are in their respective districts, and what can the Representative from California or Mon(Continued at 5, Col. 6) ZINC CEMENT GLAVES Korber & Co, Inc. lost Recently In San Juan or on the Island, TWO Tuxedo shirt BOTTOMS, of brilliants.

The Genera! Frank Lejeune Parker (x) Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, surrounded by the distinguished personalities who went to receive him at the dock.
The Governor of the Island Police, Commissioner of Health Ortiz, Commissioner of the Interior Esteves, Commissioner of Instruction Huvke, Deputy Commissioner Vizcarrondo, Colonel Helms of the 65th Infantry and other distinguished personalities were present to receive him at the pier. Governor Roosevelt was unable to meet General Parker at the pier because, according to information he received from the offices of the shipping company, the steamer would arrive with some delay at our port, at which time the Governor took advantage of the opportunity to go to visit Puerta de Tierra and visit the port.
The Governor took advantage of this time to pay a visit to Puerta de Tierra, which we report elsewhere in this same edition. Then the news was received at the Palace that the "Catherine" would dock at the usual time. General Parker arrived at St. Catherine's Palace and immediately went up to greet Governor Roosevelt in his private office. We informed Mr. Terry, our Private Secretary, of our desire to speak for a few minutes with the General and he replied that he would gladly accede to our request.

' The General greeted us warmly. "Do you speak English?" he questioned us in clear Spanish. -"Yes, sir," we replied, "and since you speak our language so well, we would be grateful if you would continue to speak to us in it. The Governor speaks to us in Spanish when he receives us, we pointed to Mr. Roosevelt.

A PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR ON ARMIS- ; TICE DAY.
. < M Government offices to close at noon-A silent tribute M
Governor Roosevelt issued the following proclamation yesterday, "November 11 is the anniversary of the day on which the Armistice was declared, ending the World War. This day has a very deep significance for all of us, as citizens of the United States, because our nation entered into that War, to justify its ideals, and succeeded happily. "To commemorate, therefore, the ideals of the soldiers who gave themselves to the great cause, I order that all Government offices be closed at noon on November 11, and I suggest that private institutions do the same. At twelve o'clock, I will ask the people of the island to remain quiet for two minutes, in reverence to the memory of those who offered their lives. I wish that my fellow citizens of this island would carry this thought with them on so solemn a day. Prayers for the glorious dead are appropriate; memorials to their memory are just. But prayers pass after the moment they are raised, and time corrodes the most majestic monuments. Our soldiers killed in action are entitled to a perpetual memory that will last through the centuries. Let us, therefore, work together unselfishly to build as a tribute to their memory, the happiness and welfare of this Island, which they loved IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have signed this Proclamation and caused to be affixed thereto the Great Seal of Puerto Rico, in the City of San Juan, this 8th day of November, A. D" nineteen hundred and twenty-nine. Theodore ROOSEVELT " Governor. Promulgated according to law, hoj', November 8, 1923. E. J. Saldaña Executive Secretary of Puerto Rico.
TOMORROW THE SPECIAL CONGRESS OF THE FREE FEDERATION WILL BEGIN M The Governor will speak on Armistice Day M The Acting President of the Free Federation of Puerto Rican Workers, Mr. Prudencio Rivera Martinez, yesterday authorized the following information: "In accordance with the call that in due time was published and sent to all labor organizations, the next Special Convention of the Free Federation of Workers of Puerto Rico, which was agreed upon on Labor Day to be held as soon as a change occurs in the government of Puerto Rico? will open its sessions at the Ateneo Portorriqueño tomorrow, Sunday, the 10th of this month, at ten o'clock in the morning. "All labor organizations should be prepared to attend, sending the largest representation, so that the important problems to be discussed may receive the widest consideration. "The principal question to be considered and discussed at this Special Convention is the memorial to be delivered to Governor Roosevelt, containing those ideas and suggestions which organized labor considers should be the subject of study by our Executive.
