Bolivar Pagan, VI-ce-president of the Socialist Party, sends us for publication the following article: THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC OPINION III. "It is convenient that we continue to analyze calmly and coldly the reasons v the right that the public opinion of Puerto Rico, and therefore its political parties, has to intervene decidedly in the organization of its government.

By the Treaty of Paris, the United States reserved to itself the right to decide the political and civil status of Puerto Rico and its inhabitants. That right was exercised by Congress, establishing for the time being a regime of an expressly transitory character. Under the Foraker Act, the voice of public opinion did not prevail in any of the three classic branches of government. The legislative branch was a hybrid spawn where the representation of the Puerto Rican people was constantly stifled and mocked, and in the course of government the public opinion of the country could be disregarded. In the executive and legislative branches, public opinion was less involved. Only by the generosity and complacency of the chief executive did the people have representation in the administration of the country. Under the transitional regime established by the Foraker Act, there was no government of public opinion in Puerto Rico.

THE GOVERNOR LEFT YESTERDAY WITHOUT NOTICE
M To the interior of the Is-la.-Cadet position at the Naval Academy M Upon visiting the representatives of the Press yesterday at La Fortaleza we were informed that Governor Roosevelt had left at half past seven in the morning for the interior of the island accompanied by his Secretary Mr. Charles H. Terry. Neither the Military Adjutant. Lt. Segaira. nor Miss Hensey, his private Secretary, knew where Colonel Roosevelt had gone. The Chief Executive had informed us that he intended to visit some towns of the island among them Mayagiiez, and to make likewise a visit to the Riego de Isabela and other dependencies of the Government without previous notice. Thus - we announced it in due time. Lieutenant Segarra gave us the following note: "Governor Roosevelt has appointed a commission composed of Hon. Emilio del Toro. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Hon. Juan B. Huyke, Commissioner of Instruction, Lt. E. E. Pettee, of the United States Navy, and Colonel Raul Esteves, with the object that, after a (Continued on 6. Col. 4)
"BARCELO ACCEPTS THE GOVERNOR'S WHIP."
(( M And instead rejects a nomination if it is made in accordance with the will of his Puerto Rican brothers," says Martinez Nadal M
The President of the Puro Republican Party, Sen. Senator Rafael Martínez Nadal, authorizes the following statements commenting on others of Don Antonio R. Barceló on the margin of the nomination of Don Manuel V. Domenech for Treasurer of Puerto Rico: - "I never expected Mr. Barceló to publish a total disavowal of all his policies prior to this moment. He always fulminated his thunderbolts against all who would conspire or work against the sovereignty of the Legislature and the intervention of politics in the affairs of the Government and in the appointment of executive officers, and suddenly, because he sees himself with three Senators in the Senate and nine or ten Representatives in the Lower House, and three Department Heads whom he perhaps considers in danger, he does not bravely meet the objections against the nomination of Mr. Domenech for Treasurer of Puerto Rico, from the
political point of view, i.e., from the lack of consultation with Senators and political leaders. "Mr. Barceló does not even dare to claim his fantastic majority of electors, to, based on it, confront the Governor over the nomination of Mr. Domenech without prior consultation with Mr. Barceló* his Senators and his party, and instead of doing this, he bends his head and accepts Mr. Domenech's nomination without campaigning against it, provided this nomination is an appointment by the Governor without political compromise and without recommendation from the pure Republicans and the Socialists, and instead alleges that he would repudiate it if this nomination of Domenech had obeyed recommendations from the pure Republicans or the Coalition, i.e., that he accepts the whipping of the Governor who is not appointed by the popular will Continued on Page 6 Col. 3)

MEMORIAL SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR
M For the "Free Federation of the Workers of Puerto Rico" - m ;
On Thursday morning, at half past ten o'clock, the Acting President and the General Secretary of the Free Federation, Messrs. Prudencio Rivera Martinez and Rafael Alonso Torres, respectively, visited Governor Roosevelt and submitted to him the memorandum agreed upon at the special Assembly of the Free Federation of the Workers of Puerto Rico held recently in the halls of the Ateneo Portorriqueño. Governor Roosevelt reviewed the document in question and told the commissioners of the Free Federation that he had dealt with many of the matters mentioned in the various speeches delivered at the University, at the Assembly of Farmers, at the Congress of Municipal Assemblies and at the Congress of the Free Federation itself. Governor Roosevelt also indicated to Mr. Prudencio Rivera Martínez and Mr. Rafael Alonso Torres that he had decided and that he would inform the representatives of the Press in the afternoon to appoint Mr. Manuel V. Domenech to the position of Treasurer of Puerto Rico, to which Mr. Rivera Martínez replied that neither he nor his wife had decided to appoint Mr. Manuel V. Domenech to the position of Treasurer of Puerto Rico.
Rivera Martínez replied that neither he nor his partner Alonso Torres had attended La Fortaleza in order to discuss such matter. The following is the memorial of the Free Federation that was delivered yesterday to the Governor: To the Honorable Theodore Roosevelt, Governor of Puerto Rico. Executive Mansion, San Juan, P. R. * ■"Ai-,;. We come to the Prime Magistrate and the highest representation of our country, trusting that the love of Puerto Rico and the aspirations of Justice, which now pervade the atmosphere of the People of the United States, and of Puerto Rico, will cause decisive action to be taken to prevent this people from being converted permanently into a great Factory of exploited workers, from the fields, factories, workshops and offices. - Mr. Governor: As the Legislative Assembly of the people of Puerto Rico, the highest representation of the country, meets, continued on p. 15, col. 3,
HUYKE DESISTS FROM THE MEETING
M The Commissioner of Public Instruction, Mr. Juan B. Huyke, stated several weeks ago in our columns that it was his purpose to summon the School Directors of the different municipalities of the island to a meeting in San Juan, for the purpose of discussing all those matters related to public instruction and the powers and problems that are under the immediate jurisdiction of said municipal officials. Mr. Huyke claimed that he had already talked about this matter with several school directors, who were in agreement with his plan. But the President of the School Directors Association in a recent circular letter suggests to his colleagues that they refrain, if they deem it convenient, from attending this meeting called by Commissioner Huyke. We have questioned Mr. Huyke as to whether he persists in his intention to hold such a meeting and he has stated that he has desisted from the meeting.
