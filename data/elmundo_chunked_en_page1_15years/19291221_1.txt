GOVERNOR LEFT FOR THE INTERIOR YESTERDAY
M He had in mind to visit the Lares camps M Governor Roosevelt left yesterday, in the early hours of the morning, for the interior of the island, accompanied by his Secretary, Mr. Charles H. Terry, his Military Ayuaante Major Crockett and the Commissioner of the Interior, Don Guillermo Esteves. The Chief of the Insular Executive had informed the representatives of the Press that he would shortly resume his unannounced tours of the island. When Governor Roosevelt does not announce his excursions, it is because he intends to visit towns he already knows and, moreover, to stay in each place he visits as long as necessary to become acquainted with the problems he wishes to know. In Fortaleza they do not know what itinerary Governor Roosevelt intended to follow yesterday, they do not know which towns he would visit and when he would return. However, judging from the reports we have obtained we can be sure that Colonel Roosevelt had in mind to visit the Lares fields. A cablegram from Fabio Fiallo M The illustrious Dominican poet Fabio Fiallo, who has so many friends in Puerto Rico, wired us thus from Santo Domingo: EL MUNDO, San Juan. I share the joy of Puerto Rico for the acquittal of Francesclii Caballero. FIALLO
