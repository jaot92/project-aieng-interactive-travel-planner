The problem being faced by the island's tobacco producers is considered difficult but not gmve by the > I Uomislomido de Agricultor a y Uo1 mételo, Mr. J.iiis A.

"In my double capacity as Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce and President of the Board of the Tobacco Institute, I am obliged to take an interest in the problems inherent in this product, and as we must be fair, I must say that in this work I can count on the determined support of the Director of the Tobacco Institute. The Director of the Tobacco Institute, Mr. Antonio Rojas, and Mr. S. Adams, a tobacco expert from the United States Department of Agriculture, who has come to Puerto Rico at my request with the sole purpose of being at our side in order to attend to and solve this problem," said Mr. Jzqu'eidn. He added: "I don't call it a serious situation. Personally I think it is difficult, (but let me add that I also believe that it has a satisfactory solution, we believe that the solution will be satisfactory for all those who are directly or indirectly affected by the problem, but what we are looking for is a solution that is favorable to all those who are directly or indirectly affected by it.
We believe that the solution will be satisfactory for all those who directly or indirectly have something to do with the business. We are trying to find a middle ground, with each party recovering its expenses and making a fair and reasonable profit.

I .a Seventh Division took that village, which was one of the fortified points on the hill where from 10,000 to 10,000 Nipponese had dug in for the battle. Perhaps (iushic'hno is the gateway to the fortress currently surrounded by four divisions. The Marine and Army forces are advancing relentlessly, pushing the Japanese to the sea under violent lilacs with flamethrower tanks and artillery. The 1st Marine Division, under General Del Valle, cut the Japanese pocket in two by reaching the south coast at a point a thousand yards west of Doman. On the right flank of the dlvlion, the Sixth Division is only 3,500 yards from the village of Gttahl. On the Yaeju-Dake hill, the Sixth Division gained 1,000 meters to the northeast of Yuza and there is a possibility that it will outflank the Japanese positions in that area.

In a statement, the Tokyo Indian said that good weather has allowed the Japanese to resume attacks by their suicide planes against the U.S. fleet on the islands, Meanwhile, the Japanese are not sure what attitude to adopt toward Okinawa, the Japanese mission said that "there is no denying that the Okinawa attack will have a profound effect.on the whole war," while olie maintained that "it was never thought that Okinawa would decide the fate of the nation." An official dispatch from Admiral Nimitz indicates that on April 1, at the beginning of the campaign, the Japanese had in Okinawa an army of 3,000 troops, 66,3,24 of whom have been annihilated to date.

Mr. Maximino Vázquez, of the local offices of the CCA. informed EL MUNDO, on the other hand, that the total amount of the subsidy from the Coi pmnrinn de Crédito Agricola, to the harvesters and sugar producers of the Island, for this year, is expected to reach ten million <|itinienlos thousand dollars. As for sugar production for 1944, it was originally estimated at 936,000 tons, but it was thought that this amount would not be reached due to the effects of the recent sugar cane strike. It is believed that the original estimate will be achieved because, as indicated, there has been a good cane yield, The estimated subsidy payment for this crop year to cane harvesters and sugarcane harvesters, of $10,500,0(10), is for both the facto. Ha as well as to the agricultural phase of the industry. It is estimated that of this total, two million will go to the industrial phase and the remaining eight million to the agricultural phase.
Agricultural implements (which now have priority of preference) It is also announced that farmers will be able to purchase directly from manufacturers. - Gordon Koole explains the amendments
Farmers have been given AA-2 priority claxifjcaeion for obtaining the farm implements they need, as Regulation 19, which relates to farm equipment, was amended yesterday by the War Prodilation Board. Notification of this amendment was received yesterday by the director of possessions and territories of the federal agency in San Juan, Mr. Gordon W. Foote. The action of the JPG places farmers on the same level of preference for the purchase of implements as any other agency engaged in the war effort. With inlcrimjfnwl * the passage of the amendment, farmers will be able to have the same preference for the purchase of implements as any other war effort.
i cuitóles were entitled to AA-2X or AA-3 priority and could obtain these materials at the level of mavolislas, More significant than this new preference classification, .is considered to be aimed at enabling the farmer to make direct purchases from the fabrldahles, as explained a.ver. Previously the purchase had to be made through the délallisla. "The amendment," said Mr. Gordon W. Fool, "has been passed in order to assist farmers in obtaining the implements necessary for this crop.
Air Transportation Commander Kerr Explains Priority Granting
By ANTULIO RODRIGUEZ Editor of EL MUNDO The Air Priority Control Office of the Military Department of the Antilles operates, not on direct orders from the local military authorities, but from the headquarters of the U.S. Air Force in Washington. In charge of this office, which is in charge of everything related to the granting of priorities of this nature, is the engineer Rafael W. Kerr, a Puerto Rican who for many years was connected with air transportation companies and who, after the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, was called to serve in the United States Army, which he entered with the rank of lieutenant. He was later promoted to first lieutenant and later to captain. Major Kerr's promotion to this rank was recently announced by the Army Public Affairs office in Puerto Rico. The priority office for the Department of the West Indies has jurisdiction over the entire Caribbean and the Caribbean area.
The priorities office for the Department of the West Indies has jurisdiction over the entire Caribbean area and deals with all matters relating to military aviation and is responsible for considering and extending American commercial aviation priorities. Explaining to an editor of El. WORLD the scope of his work, Major Kerr said that the Priorities Office does not interfere in any way with individual airline companies, leaving them to operate in complete autonomy. Its intervention begins when any person, whose activities are directly related to the war effort, has to make an urgent or immediate trip, needing for it a priority from the military authorities in order to be given priority in obtaining a ticket. REQUIREMENTS The comaudanie Kerri explains to us that there is a "misunderstanding, from the public, as to how such priorities are requested and how they are obtained.
First of all - he explained - it is necessary that the person requesting the priority is directly related to the war effort. Having established this, the person must apply to the Government department or agency which requires his or her presence in the United States or for which he or she is working, and it is then the agency which must apply for the priority by contacting the Air Force Priorities Office. The request must be accompanied by a form which must state the name of the applicant, the position held, the reasons for requesting the priority, the work being performed, the address, the point of departure and destination, the signature of the requesting agency and the signature of the passenger. This request does not determine the automatic granting of priority. The Priority Office will then decide whether or not to grant the requested priority after examining the reasons for the request.
