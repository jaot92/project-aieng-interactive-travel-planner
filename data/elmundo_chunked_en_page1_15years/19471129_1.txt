Cuban sugar is at the same price
Futures market not yet affected by tariff reduction Expected to rise as tariff is lowered Situation would affect Puerto Rico in 1948 if there is no change.
The reduction "rnm' l.n úr a lo" Cuban sugars lia not shown a reaction fas ornóle *n rl mo cado da futures d* Num a York, according to "a informó ".The Cuban sugar market was expected to see a 25 cent per quintal reduction in the price of Cuban sugar in the futures market in the same proportion as the reduction. However, the latest information received from the Rolsa del Azu-■ car r*'rlg that prices have remained more or less at the same level. Even though Fucilo Rico does not currently have any । sugars for sale in the futures market, the local producers believe that if this situation continues, sales for the 1948 harvest will be affected. As is well known. Puerto Rico will have to count on the fluctuations of a free market for arms from the next harvest onward, provided that the Government's intervention in the purchase of the next raffle is not forthcoming. The azocar futures market closed, -!

At these mnnmfitns cpp, "io । of Cuban azucm delivered over dock in New York is $6 32. ¡ which* means that the."According to local industry leaders, only a secretariat determination fixing a rehalued quota for domestic consumption could restore sugar prices to a more reasonable level. The fixing of such a quota is to be made by the United States Department of Agriculture, in accordance with the terms of the 1948 Sugar Act, within the first ten days of next year. It is the opinion of the producers that the loosening of prices for future deliveries could be maintained as long as the Federal Government fixes a high national consumption quota, and that Puerto Rican sugar sales would have to be made at low prices to break up the abundant Cuban production. These hearings will be held under the auspices of the federal Department of Agriculture and will be attended by representatives of industry, commerce and government officials. The elimination of controls on sugar prices has also had no beneficial effect on sugar prices.

Says Government should give aid to Puerto Ricans who have desire* to migrate Controversy is over overpopulation Declared population is not riipieza if people cannot be given work By CHARLES R. McCABE WASHINGTON, Nov. 2R - (PU> Today there was published in the divo newspaper "The Socialist ('nil", under the signature of Clarence Senior, secretary of the Population Association of Puerto Rico, a strong attack on the views d* Felix S. Cohen's contention to the effect that Puerto Rico can achieve a high level of population only through the development of commercial, industrial and cultural techniques that have been achieved in other lands of equal population density. . In his rebuttal, Senior claimed that Cohén "completely ignored" in his contention "such significant factors" as capital accumulation, commercial competition, historical development, educational and cultural development and social structure, He added that even the question of population density was considered by Cohén to be "completely irrelevant. Senior said that people are not a source of wealth unless they can be put to work. He indicated that employment in Pueilq Rico is as high as the lOOJMX), with a labor force that amounts to "about 1,000,000 people," even in times of "prosperity." Senior added that the people who have insufficient employment opportunities must be added to the above figure and that they numbered between 100,000 and 1,000,000 during the past year. He went on to say that annually there are added to the insular labor force, a* 17,000 person" "trained > di*posed* to work." With the present rate of pohlaclnnal increase, dl|o Senior, there will be on the Island two million d* inhabitant.* by .1960, "The Puerto Rican Government," he added, "has been trying en*t-, git anient* to stimulate! industiiHs, * to establish themselves rn the Island, The Government itself builds factories in those cases where extensive economic studies demonstrate the feasibility d" such*.* The government itself builds factories in cases where extensive economic studies show the feasibility of such enterprises and where, despite clin, private investment cannot be achieved, "The government has dexiiiinlllHiin the hydroelectric industry, has subsidized studies of mineral resources, has undertaken the development of new types of agricultural practices, and is currently building a series of vocational training schools. Contrary to Cohén's ai gunienf ation, Senior said, no "contemporary economist looks to migration as the 'cure' for Puerto Rican problems." Senior goes on to say that "the cmocinnRlism Cohén lavishes in drawing a parallel between 1* emigration and the ancient practice of bloodletting m Ir Medicine is something that speaks to his heart, but it adds nothing to the discussion, *xicpio the damage that rhetoric of that nature does by interfering with the lazonamientn when it comes to establishing a balanced program.'o to deal with a specific situation."
