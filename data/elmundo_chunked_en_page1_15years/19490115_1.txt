State Defends - , Right to Arm Against Russia
Authorized Strong Statement Yesterday - Qree Soviet Potential Aggressor Undermines United Nations By DONALD J. GONZALEZ WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (PU)Russia has created such a "terror and insecurity" in the world that free nations must unite and arm themselves for their mutual defense, the State Department said today, attacking the Soviet Union in a forceful 3,000-word statement outlining U.S. policy and saying that the United States must join the North Atlantic alliance and supply arms to Western democracies because "an aggressor has undermined the pacifist machinery of the United Nations. The statement, entitled "Building Peace," was distributed to representatives of 250 private organizations who met here to discuss plans to support the United Nations civil rights program. The document is one of the most outspoken ever issued by the State Department, and directly accuses the Soviet Union of "obstructing" United Nations efforts to build a peaceful world. Military Nest The Department advocates continuation of Marshall's economic aid plan,* but says the reconstruction program may be "crippled" if Marshall does not also provide overt military aid to keep communism within the iron curtain quarantine line. The Department's statement added that as the morale of the nations of Western Europe rose with the prospects offered by the European reconstruction program, Communist pressure increased throughout the continent, particularly in France and Italy. Communist-led minorities in Western Europe tried unsuccessfully to dominate or weaken constitutional governments and to disorganize the economic life of those countries. In Eastern Europe, Soviet efforts concentrated on the consolidation of communist control and the elimination of freedom, The Czech Case T In February 1948, the statement continues, the free and democratic government of Czechoslovakia was overthrown by a communist coup d'état. In March and April 1948 the Soviet Union, in violation of agreements made with Great Britain, France and the United States. France and the United States initiated a series of provocative acts which culminated in the total land blockade of Berlin, thereby creating a situation of grave threat to peace. The Czech-Slovakian crisis shook Western Europe deeply and made it realize that it had to be prepared to face a crisis at any moment. The sense of insecurity continued to grow as the possibility of a sudden outbreak of violence in Berlin was considered.
Fear and insecurity, says the State Department, may paralyze the reconstruction effort, and obstruct the psychological basis on which reconstruction depends. (Continued on page 10) Drivers Decide to Go to Election AT Bus Strike Dissipated The threat of a strike which had been hanging over the transportation service provided by the Transportation Authority in the Metro-Politan Area was lifted late yesterday. Union leaders, who had given the TA until 2:00 p.m. to agree to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with them, agreed to go to a consent election to determine which board is legally authorized by the agency's drivers and mechanics. Three antagonistic groups were vying for the right to represent TA employees in collective bargaining. The previous union leadership, chaired by senior Raimundo Lebrón, was deposed by a union assembly held in December, and a new leadership was elected and asked for recognition of the TA to bargain. The previous directive also claimed to be the representative of the workers, as well as another group called "of unification" presided by Mr. José Avila. Doubt in the TA The TA, in doubt as to which board was authorized to negotiate, turned to the Labor Relations Board to determine which board was authorized to negotiate (Continued on page 10),

Red Forces Have Already Entered Tientsin
U.S. Vice Consul Wounded in Attack I<a Communist Radio Sent Offer Purely to Negotiate Peace WASHINGTON, Jan. 14,-(PU). -Communist artillery fire today wounded an American official at the offices of the United States Information Service and damaged the American Consulate in Tientsin, China. The State Department received information to the effect that a shell exploded at the Information Service offices near the French Consulate. The windows and glass doors of the Consulate were "blown out" as the continuation of the bombardment caused a "terrible explosion" at the Shell Oil Co. facility. The shells were still falling around the Consulate at the time of the last dispatch sent by Consul General Robert L. Smyth, and American officials took cover inside the building behind bulwarks made of piles of carpet. Reds Entered Tlentaln (Chinese Communist radio claimed that Red forces entered the city at noon today, following a general attack that began two hours earlier. Communist forces have been two weeks in the suburbs of 1a major port city in septentrlonal China). Smyth said the explosion at the Shell Oil Co. facility started a "huge fire" that began two hours earlier. It started a "huge fire" that "is still burning and spreading-' ae dangerously." He identified the injured American as Vice Consul Sam L. Yates of Detroit. Yates was reported to have been "slightly injured" by glass dislodged by the explosion. The same impact caused minor injuries to an unidentified Chinese employee. No injuries were reported in the main Consulate building. Smyth, a native of Berkeley, California, originally reported the damage to the Consulate in a dispatch issued shortly after noon.
An hour and a half later, he reported that shells were falling "closer to our building," and that Consulate staff members were "concentrated in the corridors and sheltered behind piles of carpeting, and away from the windows." The State Department estimated that 82 American civilians were still in the Tientsin area. No estimates are available as to military personnel. ; '
Situation Worsening In his 1:30 p.m. dispatch, Smyth said the situation in Tientsin appeared to be worsening "rapidly." He added that "romo we are detained in our office by a curfew and urtillerla fire, we are unable to determine the turn of events in distant sections of the city." Michael J. McDermott, spokesman (Continued on page 10)
By WARREN DUFFEE WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 - (PU) - Senate and House leaders today agreed on a timetable for consideration of President Truman's anti-inflaclona-rian program. This schedule gives priority to legislation to extend rent and export controls. The President's request for price controls, rationing and salt controls will probably not be considered until Congress has disposed of other more urgent legislation, which expires soon, Mr. Truman himself expressed doubts about the need for such powers. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Burnet R. Maybank, D-S.C., disclosed the agreement in announcing the chairmanships" of several Senate subcommittees* that will deal with different aspects of the program. He said he had agreed with House Banking Committee Chairman Brent Spence, D-Kentucky, on the manner in which these two key committees will consider Mr. Truman's economic proposals. The committees, which will determine how soon legislation reaches the Senate and House floors, will first consider rent controls. The latter expire on February 28. The rent law expires on March 31. John J. Sparkman, D-Alabama, will chair the Senate Rent and Housing Committee. Sparkman, who had to move out of his apartment when he refused to buy it, said hearings would begin as soon as the group receives final recommendations from the Administration. Sparkman doubts this will happen before the President's inauguration day. As soon as the rent controls issue is resolved. dMo, the subcommittee will begin work on housing legislation introduced last week, by seven Democratic senators, (Continued on page 10)

Claims Against the Railroad Discussed A $989,000 Bondholder Claim. - Before Judge David Chavez of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rico, several claims were argued yesterday against the Railroad Company, which is the subject of a proposed reorganization plan. The largest of the claims was argued by James R. Beverley, Esq. on behalf of some 2,000 French, Belgian and Spanish settlers. This claim amounts to some $16,000,000. The second most important claim is that of the railroad workers, represented by Luis A. Duhón, Esq. The workers' claim amounts to $989,000,000. Offer to Compromise Originally the workers had sued the Railroad Company for the amount of $3,000,000, but there is an offer tentatively accepted by the parties, to compromise the claim for the amount of $989,000. Another claim corresponds to attorney Mariano Acosta Velarde, for the amount of $10,000 that he alleges the Railroad Company owes him for professional services rendered. Mr. Acosta Velarde also represented the pensioned employees of the Railroad Company. To liquidate this last claim, the amount of $10,000 has been proposed in the Reorganization Plan of the Railroad Company. i After hearing the presentation of the attorneys for the Company's creditors, Judge Chavez decreed a recess to continue the hearing.

Commission Will Visit Dewey To Ask Him To Save Monge
By Jamos B. CAN EL NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (PU)Jorge Luis Monge of Puerto Rico, whose execution in the electric chair has been set for next week, is waiting to die "calm and stoic" but still hoping that Gov. Thomas E. Dewey will commute his sentence before the fatal hour, according to his defense lawyer. Monge, who is a decorated veteran of the last war, was sentenced to death in 1947 with two companions, Wally Grant and Eugene Pannel, for the murder of a Chilean sailor, Guillermo Orlando Torres Nunez. The triple execution, according to the decision of the Tribunal, will take place in the course of the week that begins on Monday. Attorney Lucha Oscar Gonzalez Suarez, the defense attorney, visited Mongo today in Sing Slng, trying to collect some data that could serve as a basis to request a new trial and thus obtain a stay of execution. But after a long conversation with Monge, he came to the conclusion that there is no hope for an act of clemency by the Governor. "Monge," he said on his return to New York, "was unable to give me additional facts, which would serve to make
another effort by legal means to save his life. "I found Monge calm and stoic, and very hopeful that an act of clemency by Governor Dewey.-the last resort-would save his life." Grateful Monge Monga gave Gonzalez Suarez a verbal message to all the people and institutions working for the commutation of his sentence, thanking them for their efforts and promising that he will set an example of good citizenship if he is returned to freedom. To all my friends and relatives," said the message given to the publicity by the lawyer, "I say that I am resigned to any fate. But I do not lose hope that God will help me, since he saved my life on the battle fronts." After thanking everyone, he asks to continue his struggle to achieve the Governor's benevolence," he said. "I will prove that in my heart there is a lot of goodness. I will not only serve the community, but I will set an example of good citizenship." He will visit Dewey Gonzalez Suarez, who as president of the Puerto Rican Action Legal Committee, as well as a drowning advocate, has been the propellant .(Continued on page 10).

Already 1,536 Patients in the Asylum
Institutional Work Also Includes Outdoor Recreation Plan By LUI" HERNANDEZ AQUINO EL MUNDO Staff Writer The Department of Health has reported on the movement of patients in the Insular Asylum, and on various activities carried out by them during the fiscal year I947-4R, As of the beginning of the current fiscal year, July 1, 1948, there were a total of 1,536 patients in the Insular Asylum, 772 of whom were men, and 746 women. Life is not so bleak for the mentally ill confined there, who engage in occupational therapy activities and have their amusements just like other humans. At present, a choir of Jos patients is organized by a University professor and a planner, who volunteer their services. They play baseball. Groups of patients play outdoors on days when the weather is warm enough. There are volleyball and baseball teams in which different patients participate. On Wednesdays at "rie la larri", lively dances are held among those patients of both sexes whose conditions allow it. Another of the activities organized is an orchestra composed of those patients who are in better mental condition. In the rainy days they are entertained in parlor games, such as rhomino, checkers and cards. Recently, the University Choir gave a special concert for the seniors. Occupaclnnal Therapy The male patients are apparently the most industrious, as is evident from the work done last fiscal year, when 30 women and 10 men were engaged in occupational therapy work. The men made 61 items, consisting of pincushions and carpentry items, while the women made only 49 items, consisting of sewing, sewing and fretwork. Of the one hundred and ten articles made by the patients during the year, 65 were sold, making a profit of one hundred and fifty-three dollars and sixty cents. 102 Deaths Recorded At the beginning of the fiscal year there were 1,269 patients in the Island Insane Asylum; 1,002 were admitted and 735 discharged. The previous year, 472 were admitted and 523 discharged. At the end of the last fiscal year, 1,536 patients were hospitalized and during the year 517 patients were discharged on parole. The courts of Justice of Puerto Rico referred 22 cases of offenders, nineteen of whom were males and three females, to the asylum for observation. Also* 21 cases of offenders were admitted for hospitalization. Cases admitted on orders of the courts numbered 427. Of these, 242 were males and 185 females.
Patients discharged for the date totaled 517. Without psychosis, 12 were discharged (eight males and four females); with decreased symptoms, 11; and with no improvement, 16. Of these, 144 are cases with decreased symptoms: 92 improved and 147 unimproved. There are also eight discharged without psychosis, and nine with unknown mental status. Of the 102 deaths registered during the year 1, heart disease and tuberculosis reached the highest percentage. Other causes of death were respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal origin. Treatment and Religious Service In total, there were 431 patient treatments, with the highest number being eltroconvulsion, which reached 407. There were also other treatments of cases of alcoholism, narcosis, by means of artificial fever and autohemotherapy. There were also 64 reports of different types, and 1,933 cases were treated in the dental department. (Continued on page 10).
