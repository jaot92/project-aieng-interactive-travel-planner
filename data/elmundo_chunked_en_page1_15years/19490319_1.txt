Atlantic Pact Binds the U. S. for 20 Years
* Western Europe Must Give Aid Acheson Says Must Declare War, Should Aggression Against Signatories For DONALD J| GONZALES WASHINGTON, March 18. - (PU) - The North Atlantic Pact would bind the United States. for the next twenty years to aid Western Europe in repelling any Russian aggression, but in aiding European nations, will use armed force only when Congress decides that such action is necessary. The pact, one of the greatest peacetime defensive alliances, was published today. It will be signed in this capital in early April. The general impression of the people in this capital is that the pact will be ratified quickly in the United States Senate. And in London, Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevln told a cheering House of Commons that the North Atlantic Pact has given the Western powers a tremendous advantage over the Soviet bloc, securing peace for generations to come. Ratification of the Pact by the Commons was taken for granted, because the Conservative opposition immediately pledged itself to back -1 Paeto, Frank Reaction" _ In Paris, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, said that the Atlantic Pact was a "peace" alliance, directed only against aggression. The North Atlantic Pact does not commit the United States to automatic intervention in a war in the event of Soviet aggression. Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can declare war. The Protocol commits the United States to take whatever "action is necessary" in the event of aggression against one of the signatory nations. "including the use of the strong navy." But although the Treaty preserves all the formalities required by the constitutions of the signatory nations, the chief American representative in the negotiations that culminated in the drafting of the Treaty - Secretary of State Dean Acheson - said frankly that in a large-scale attack on western Europe, he would drag the United States into the war. In a Press interview, Aeheson said that the Pact does not morally obligate the United States to enter a war over a mere border incident. He made clear his belief, however, that under the Pact, Congress should declare war if an aggressor attacked any of the signatory nations, in the way Germany attacked France in World War I and World War II. . The Secretary said that strong measures should be taken in the event of any aggression that jeopardized the security and peace of the region of the signatory countries of the treaty. Answering a question, Acheson said that an attack directed at a U.S. plane while crossing the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany would be considered an armed attack under the Pact. Revolution Does Not Compel The Secretary of State went on to say that he does not consider revolutions and internal uprisings sufficient to invoke the Pact. But he added that the situation could take on a different meaning if internal revolutions and uprisings were being financed from outside. If one of the signatory nations believed that its political independence was threatened, it could ask the other powers to study the situation, but they would not be obliged to take action. - In Key West, President Tru. man declared that the Pact has his full support. The President read the text of the Pact, as well as a speech to be delivered tonight by Acheson on the Paeto. The major Senate leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, came out today in favor of the Compact. The Pact must be approved by two thirds of the Senate to become effective. Kenneth McKellar, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he would insist that the United States be told how much it will cost the United States, which is the arsenal that will give practical value to the pact. A United Press dispatch from London states that the North Atlantic Pact, given publicity in Washington, unites about 4,800,000 soldiers of the Western nations in a single force, against about 4,900,000 Russian soldiers and their satellite countries. These forces vlrtually iguaCont, on P. 13, Col 4

That is the conclusion reached by a study recently conducted by the New York Times, through its education editor. Interested in the problem in all states and possessions, the New York Times conducted a general survey of the condition of school buildings. To arrive at the necessary conclusions, Benjamin Fine, the newspaper's education editor, contacted the state chiefs of instruction. The Department of Instruction in Puerto Rico received a form from Mr. Fine inquiring about school building needs. The study carried out reveals that, in most cases, these are in very poor condition. The shortage of buildings is so serious, according to the study, that no less than 850,000,000 would be necessary to build enough schools in which to teach the entire school population (Cont. on page 14, Col., 8).

Treasurer Leaves For U.S. Tomorrow.
Will Study Tax Collection System Favors Capital Increase Law Amendment. Legislation Prepared By Jusn Martin" Chapel Editor of El, MUNDO Legislation is being prepared in the Treasury Department to amend the income tax law with respect to "capital gain", or capital growth due to increase in the value of property. Treasurer Descartes is in favor of eliminating the "nonresident alien" phrases that apply to Puerto Ricans in the U.S. and Americans in Puerto Rico from the income tax laws, both federal and island. Most of the legislation sponsored by the Treasury Department was finalized yesterday to be submitted to the Legislative Assembly through the Executive Secretary of Puerto Rico. Held Meeting The Treasurer of Puerto Rico, Mr. Sol Luis Descartes, held conferences with the heads of divisions of his department to resolve all matters that have been under his consideration. Among those matters was the granting of new agencies of the oLterla, the number of which we did not know with certainty, but which is necessarily much lower than the number of applications filed by persons with merit to obtain them. Mr. Descartes plans to leave tomorrow for the United States. The purpose of his trip, according to what he said, is to study in the federal capital the systems for the collection of taxes, mainly on income and excise taxes. He also wants to meet with federal officials involved in tax matters or who are in any way related to Puerto Rico's affairs. He intends to send personnel from his department to receive special training in investigation techniques related to income tax and other aspects of administration. Possibly, on this trip, he will leave W√°shlngton to finalize arrangements for such training. Mr. Descartes has plans to have bank reports made in models and in the same form for all. He will make a study of the operation of banks in the United States, in connection with their mode of reporting to the Government and with Government procedures for inspecting them. It is proposed to obtain personnel experienced in the matter to examine the Puerto Rico Banking Law and the procedures for the inspection and supervision of banks used here, so that they may recommend such amendments as they deem necessary. Mr. Descartes, Seftor, is sympathetic to the proposal of the Resident Commissioner, Dr. Antonio Fern√≥s Isern, to eliminate in the income tax law of Puerto Rico the designation of "non-resident aliens" to those born in the United States and temporarily residing in the Island.

Truman caught an 18-pound barracuda." (Photo PA". * By JOHN U CUTTER CAYO HUESO, Florida, March 8. (PU)-President Truman said today that despite opposition from Southern Democrats and others, he still expects approval of most of his "fair deal" program by the United States.
"loyal deal," by Congress. -* He said the "latest" events in Congress show that the nation has a three-party system, just as it did during the presidential campaign last fall. He identified the three parties as Democrats, Republicans and Southerners. The way he said it seems to indicate that the President does not consider Southerners to be Democrats. But answering other questions during a press conference, Mr. Truman said he still hopes that some of his opponents now see the light, and he said that of course he does not consider the Southerners to be good Democrats. The President was friendly, rather than scathing, toward Congress, which has dealt heavy blows to his program of late. He reminded reporters that the first part of the current session was devoted to organizational work. "D√©niea time," he said. "Many of the members of Congress," he said, "fundamentally are doing well." He said that "we must give them the opportunity, before" to judge what they do," The President was told that at the JeffersonJackson Day luncheon, he said, to prepare his campaign train and tour the Nation on behalf of his legislative program. The President said nothing more has been done in that regard. He said that the details of that trip have not been worked out, and that there is nothing more to what he said in the above speech. Contact with Washington Seftor Truman announced nothing in particular to the Press, about his vacation. He said that he has kept in touch with developments in Washington and that he is familiar with the development of the proposed North Atlantic defense pact, that he has read the text of the pact and a speech by Secretary of State Dean Aeheson, to be delivered tonight, and that both have his absolute approval.

Mr. De Jesus had the opportunity to learn in depth about the bill which, if approved, would give the President the power to reorganize the executive branch of the Government from time to time. The plan being tried in Puerto Rico is similar to that recommended by the Hoover Committee. The Governor would have general power to reorganize the insular executive branch. Any reorganization step would be submitted to the Legislature, which, within a reasonable time, could disapprove it by concurrent resolution. Such resolutions are effective without requiring the Governor's signature. Mr. De Jes√∫s stated that he had interviewed in the United States with the most experienced persons in government reorganization matters. Among these" people are: Louis Brownlow, who was chairman of the Committee on Government Administration, appointed by President Roosevelt in 1937, and who recommended the plan which was the basis for the Government Administration Program, accepted in 1939; Luther Gulick, who was a member of that same committee, and is presently the head of the Institute of Public Administration in New York.
