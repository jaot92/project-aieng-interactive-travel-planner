Ferrer Says He Will Do Spanish Theater On The Island
Actor Leaves For Puerto Rico Today, Confesses He Sometimes Feels Homesick
Pnr MOTOR YEPEB.
NEW YORK, May 27. (PU) - José Ferrer, the brilliant Puerto Rican actor, rector and businessman on whom the University of Puerto Rico will confer an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts in recognition of his great merits, intends to return to the island someday to perform in Spanish.
gún día a la Isla y hacer teatro en*" español. Interviewed in his dressing room while he was preparing to leave for the concert, the well-known actor, consecrated by the critics of the United States, among the greatest figures of modern theater, says he feels extremely grateful to the University and the people of Puerto Rico, for the honor he will receive during the graduation exercises of the highest Puerto Rican teaching institution, on Monday, the 30th of the current month. "He came to the United States at the age of 8, in 1918," Ferrer tells us, while with a fine brush he was transforming his face for the main character in El Silbato da Plata, which he has been performing at the Biltmore Theater, at 47th Street and Broadway, for the last 7 months. He returned to Puerto Rico in several "■talones", he continues, "and studied at Colegio San Agustín, in Rio Piedras. Then in Estado! United States cursi my studies at the University of Prlneeton and then directed my steps immediately hada theatrical career, to which I always felt attracted", Complete Makeup Ferrer, who as he spoke Iba completing his preparations to go on stage, so has been gradually transforming before núestros astonished eyes, and finally, with his shabby striped pants, his colorful vest and his brightly colored jacket, he has become the vagabond of El Silbato do Plata, who arrives at a charity house to bring a ray of light and optimism to the unhappy old people confined there, who, with the arrival of! The arrival of the wanderer, with his lively Imagination, his unhurried gestures and his words full of fun and colorfulness, they feel transported to a world of happiness and joy. The play itself is an endoblo manufacture; but the Puerto Rican actor,* with his performance, full of vitality, enthusiasm and ardor, gives the comedy a value far beyond its scarce merits. El Silbato do Plata, if it had had a less competent actor than Ferrer, would never have lasted for months on the billboard, eight months during which the Puerto Rican actor has reaped (Continued on page 14, Col. 8)

WASHINGTON, May 27. (Special to THE WORLD)- The Public Buildings Act of 1949, known as the "Depression Act," approved a conference committee to provide for the construction of 20 buildings in Puerto Rico in the event of a depression, at a cost of $815,710,000. House, the measure was sent to a conference committee of both houses to settle differences in 'Bu, two versions. Although it does not provide for immediate construction, nor does it allocate funds, the measure lists projects in Puerto Rico considered by the Federal Works Agency as eligible for consideration when funds are authorized or allocated, if at all.

N. Y. Times Cites Increase In Tisisis
Notes Boricua Migration to Urbe Formulates Editorial Based on Recent Remarks by Dr. Fernós The New York Times, in its Friday edition, published an editorial under the heading "Puerto Rico and the T. B.". B." in which it says that the increase in tuberculosis in New York may be due to the conditions prevailing in Puerto Rico, "from which many physically disabled migrants arrive". The Times editorial adds that Dr. Antonio Fernós Isern, Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, discussed the issue at a recent conference on social hygiene sponsored by the New York Tuberculosis and Health Association. The full text of the editorial is as follows: "Tuberculosis has been on the increase lately. One reason for this may be the prevailing conditions in Puerto Rico, from which many disabled migrants come. Suffice it to point out that since the average number of deaths from tuberculosis in Puerto Rico is 180 per hundred thousand inhabitants, as compared with 38.4 in the city, we cannot afford to be indifferent to immigration. To protect the economic interests of the metropolis, we limit Puerto Rico's sugar quota and prohibit it from refining sugar. Certainly, factories, exempt from taxes for twelve years, are now under construction, since the Island has to build up its industry, which will solve the problem of overpopulation and reduce its high proportion of tuberculosis. As things stand, the limitations imposed on the cultivation of sugar and the collapse of coffee plantations, which cannot compete with those of South America, have prompted the workers to move from the mountains to the cities. "With* a population now oa approximately do, mlllone, (600 per square mile) and which will reach tro, million by 1960, the pressure is such that migration to the metropolis has increased from 61,483 in 1940. to 235,000 in 1949. These emigrants can be found in all parts of the metropolis, but too many of them reside in the city. Dr. Antonio Fernós Isern, resident commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, discussed this question at the recent conference on social hygiene sponsored by the New York Tuberculosis and Sanitary Association. The restriction of migration is contrary to the accepted policy of this country insofar as it concerns the movement of books between the states and territories. "In the opinion of Dr. Fornos Isern, the sugar quota should be lifted, sugar refining should be permitted, and the use of local materials by the industries should be encouraged. "In that way Puerto Rico might be able to level its exports or imports, increase its standard of living and health care, and reduce migration to a desirable minimum. Laborer, Gqaan 20 Cents, Hour With needle workers receiving only 20 cents an hour and others even monkeys. it is no wonder that what amounts to mass emigration takes place every year. The emigrants who come to New York come from the cities because their education is better than that of the agricultural laborers and because they can fight better in the metropolis. "Therefore, Dr. Fernós Isern extend the* benefit, of the Federal Aid for Instruction project to Puerto Rico for the sake of New York, which has to absorb more emigrants than any other region. "No one will disagree with his argument that "to improve the health of the Island's population, the great task is to combat poverty, eliminate the slum colonies that surround every city and town, and educate the people."
University Choir Receives Highly Commended in Washington

RODRIGUKZ
By WILLIAM DORVILUER. WASHINGTON, May 27. (Especlal para* EL MUNDO) - The University of Puerto Rico Choir scored a resounding triumph before a packed house at the Federal Labor Agency auditorium last night. In their first concert in Washington, the forty-one young people of the University of Puerto Rico received standing ovations for three of their songs, and prolonged applause for several others. Clearly nervous, they began the program with Ingegneri's Jerusalem Surge, but the reception from the audience seemed to ease the tension to such an extent that when they sang the "Kyrie Elelson" they did so with such confidence that it elicited a warm ovation at the end. Also well received were Gilberto Tillet's renditions of the Hebrew invocation, "Elll. (Continued on page 14. Col. 6)

"From said affidavits it appears that there has been an increase in the production of cow's milk in the last months of spring and said increase is due to the fact that at this time of the year there are better conditions for the cows, there are pure cane stalks to reinforce their feeding and in many sectors of Puerto Rico the "garrapatlcida bath has been eliminated because it brings as a consequence an increase in the production of cow's milk. "This cow's milk in 89 percent of its production already pasteurized is sold at home at the price of 22 rentavo* which is the same price that has been fixed for this product for a long time. That approximately 15 percent of the pasteurized cow's milk goes to the sale of bedding stalls and to the trade for resale. That 10 or 15 percent is resold at 4 cents, since at present the companies sell it to these comereiantej at 16 cents per liter, which contrasts with the price of 20 cents as they sold it in times when the production of this basic foodstuff was decreasing. "I have found no evidence in the U.S. pasteurizing companies that they have ever dumped a "whole lot of milk which is in good enough condition to be used by human beings.
